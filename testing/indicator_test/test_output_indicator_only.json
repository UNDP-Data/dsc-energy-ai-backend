        "moonshot_model_answer": "Based on the provided <Sources> extract, the average percentage of the population with access to energy, electricity, and clean cooking solutions in Haiti over the past five years can be determined by considering the following indicators:\n\n1. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, rural (% of rural population):\n   - 2019: 1.2%\n   - 2020: 1.3%\n   - 2021: 1.3%\n\n2. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, urban (% of urban population):\n   - 2019: 6.6%\n   - 2020: 6.6%\n   - 2021: 6.5%\n\n3. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (% of population):\n   - 2019: 4.1%\n   - 2020: 4.2%\n   - 2021: 4.3%\n\n4. Access to electricity, rural (% of rural population):\n   - 2019: 1.22%\n\n5. Access to electricity, urban (% of urban population):\n   - 2019: 79.92%\n   - 2020: 80.89%\n   - 2021: 81.84%\n\nBased on these indicators, we can calculate the average percentage of the population with access to energy, electricity, and clean cooking solutions in Haiti over the past five years. However, since the values for some indicators are missing for certain years, we can only provide a partial answer.\n\nThe average percentage of the population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking in Haiti over the past five years is as follows:\n- Rural areas: (1.2% + 1.3%) / 2 = 1.25%\n- Urban areas: (6.6% + 6.6% + 6.5%) / 3 = 6.57%\n- Overall population: (4.1% + 4.2% + 4.3%) / 3 = 4.2%\n\nThe average percentage of the population with access to electricity in Haiti over the past three years is as follows:\n- Rural areas: 1.22%\n- Urban areas: (79.92% + 80.89% + 81.84%) / 3 = 80.55%\n\nPlease note that the average percentage for the overall population's access to electricity cannot be calculated as the data for rural areas is missing for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, the average percentage of the population with access to energy, electricity, and clean cooking solutions in Haiti over the past five years is approximately 1.25% for clean cooking in rural areas, 6.57% for clean cooking in urban areas, 4.2% for clean cooking for the overall population, 1.22% for electricity in rural areas, and 80.55% for electricity in urban areas.",
