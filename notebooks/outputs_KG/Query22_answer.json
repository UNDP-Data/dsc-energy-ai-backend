    "user_query": "How is Nigeria addressing gender inequality within its political institutions?",
    "answer": "Nigeria is addressing gender inequality within its political institutions through various initiatives. However, it is important to note that the provided sources and entity-relation information do not directly mention specific actions or programs related to gender inequality in Nigeria's political institutions. Therefore, the answer will be based on general knowledge and assumptions.\n\nOne way Nigeria is addressing gender inequality is by promoting women's representation in political leadership roles. According to the provided entity-relation information, only 7.3% of the Senate and 5.8% of the House of Representatives in Nigeria are female legislators. This indicates a significant gender imbalance in political representation. To address this issue, Nigeria could implement policies and programs aimed at increasing the participation of women in politics, such as affirmative action measures or gender quotas.\n\nAdditionally, Nigeria could collaborate with international organizations and development partners to address gender inequality within its political institutions. The entity-relation information mentions partnerships with organizations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the governments of Norway and Germany. These partnerships could potentially include initiatives focused on promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in Nigeria's political sphere.\n\nIt is important to note that the provided sources do not provide specific details on Nigeria's efforts to address gender inequality within its political institutions. Therefore, further research and consultation of additional sources may be necessary to obtain more comprehensive and accurate information on this topic.",
