    "answer": "The UNDP supports the resilience of communities in the Diffa region of Niger by partnering with the government and other United Nations agencies. They work together to drive policies and actions that focus on preventing and reducing disaster-related risks, increasing the resilience of infrastructures, ecosystems, and society, and enabling adaptive capacities. This is done as a means to reduce the long-term vulnerability of the population and protect development investments, particularly in at-risk areas. The UNDP also participates in joint Government-United Nations coordination mechanisms and establishes multi-stakeholder partnerships on priorities for the Sustainable Development Goals. By employing national monitoring systems, official statistical data, and reports from line ministries, development partners, and research institutions, the UNDP measures its contribution to national results and ensures the effectiveness of its interventions.",
