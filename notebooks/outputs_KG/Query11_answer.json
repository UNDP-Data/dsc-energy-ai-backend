    "answer": "The UNDP is implementing several strategies to support Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy. One of the strategies is partnering with the government to drive policies and actions that focus on disaster risk reduction, increasing resilience, and enabling adaptive capacities. This is aimed at reducing the long-term vulnerability of the population and protecting development investments, particularly in at-risk areas.\n\nAdditionally, the UNDP is working with civil society and the government to improve human capacities and data systems for performance, transparency, and planning. They are also focusing on the quality of services and the rule of law in collaboration with other United Nations partners.\n\nFurthermore, the UNDP has established multi-stakeholder partnerships on priorities for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are aligning their results framework with indicators related to European Union accession, the National Statistical Development Indicator (NSDI), and the national indicator framework for the SDGs.\n\nThe UNDP is also employing national monitoring systems, official statistical data, and reports from line ministries, development partners, and research institutions to measure its contribution to national results. This monitoring and evaluation plan will be implemented following endorsement by the Executive Board.\n\nOverall, the UNDP is actively supporting Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy through various strategies, including partnerships with the government, focusing on the SDGs, and implementing monitoring and evaluation plans.",
