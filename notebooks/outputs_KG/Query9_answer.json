The renewable energy share in Albania is predominantly hydropower of which accounts for 95% of all generating capacity, with the remaining divided between solar (1%) and crude oil (4%). The remaining share of supply comes from imports making Albania a net energy importer and thus heavily reliant on imports. Being also heavily reliant on hydropower also means that renewable generation is sensitive to rainfall, of which has seen considerable annual variations and a steady decline in recent years. This is likely to further decline with the effects of climate change. In addition to hydropower resources, Albania also has abundant solar and wind resources, which are currently almost entirely untapped. In order to improve energy security and climate resilience and to",
