    "answer": "Niger and Nigeria face several challenges in achieving sustainable development. Some of these challenges include poverty, unemployment, limited financial resources, and limited access to water and sanitation. \n\nIn Niger, the economy has grown at an average rate of 5% over the past ten years, but experienced a setback in 2011 due to a poor harvest and food grain shortage. However, it bounced back in 2012 with a growth rate of 13%. The country is supported by organizations such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development, African Economic Outlook, World Bank, UNESCO, and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Niger is also a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and has partnerships with the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Orange.\n\nNigeria, on the other hand, has the largest economy in Africa but still faces challenges in achieving sustainable development. The country has a high poverty rate of 40% and unemployment rate of 33%. To address these challenges, Nigeria has implemented various strategies and policies. For example, the government has developed the Country Programme Document for Nigeria (2023-2027) in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, and the United Nations Office for Project Services. This document outlines the programme priorities and partnerships for achieving sustainable development in Nigeria.\n\nAdditionally, Nigeria has a National Gas Policy that aims to define the policy of the Federal Government in respect of Nigeria's natural gas endowment and establish targets for gas reserves growth and utilization. The policy also addresses the challenges facing Nigeria in the gas sector. Nigeria is also making efforts to increase its renewable energy supply, with a focus on hydro/marine, wind, solar, bioenergy, and geothermal sources. The country has a Renewable Energy Roadmap that outlines its plans for increasing renewable energy capacity.\n\nOverall, Niger and Nigeria are addressing the challenges of sustainable development through partnerships with international organizations, implementation of strategic policies, and focus on renewable energy sources.",
