    "answer": "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Western Balkan Regional Economic Area by focusing on integrated solutions that address cross-cutting problems. This includes identifying nature-based solutions that support the transition to a clean green economy, promoting ecotourism, and creating new jobs in competitive sectors within the Western Balkan Regional Economic Area. \n\nUNDP partners with various organizations, including United Nations agencies, to achieve its goals. It also works closely with the government to improve human capacities and data systems for performance, transparency, and planning. UNDP assists the government in driving policies and actions that focus on prevention and reduction of disaster-related risks, increasing resilience of infrastructures, ecosystems, and society, and enabling adaptive capacities. This is done to reduce the long-term vulnerability of the population and protect development investments, particularly in at-risk areas.\n\nAdditionally, UNDP has established multi-stakeholder partnerships on priorities for the SDGs. It participates in joint Government-United Nations coordination mechanisms and focuses on the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. UNDP also contributes to the SDGs by employing national monitoring systems, official statistical data, and reports from line ministries, development partners, and research institutions to measure its contribution to national results. The results framework is aligned with indicators related to European Union accession, the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), and the national indicator framework for the SDGs.\n\nThe European Union also contributes to the priorities of UNDP, and the monitoring and evaluation plan will be implemented following endorsement of the Country Programme Document (CPD) by the Executive Board. UNDP supports the government in addressing structural and systemic barriers to gender equality and women's empowerment in policy formulation and implementation. It also supports the People's Advocate and broadens partnerships for a stronger good governance framework, in line with the National Public Administration Reform Strategy.",
