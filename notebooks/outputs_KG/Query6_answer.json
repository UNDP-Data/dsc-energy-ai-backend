    "answer": "The collaboration between the United Nations Country Team and the United Nations Working Group contributes to Afghanistan's development by working together to implement the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) integrated work plans. The United Nations Country Team, which includes the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), collaborates with the United Nations Working Group to ensure the successful implementation of the UNDAF. This collaboration allows for coordinated efforts and resources to address the development needs of Afghanistan.\n\nAdditionally, the United Nations Country Team collaborates with the United Nations Operations Management Team to make operational changes following the UNDP global clustering strategy. This strategy involves shifting key functions to consolidated service centers in various regions, such as Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. These operational changes aim to improve efficiency and effectiveness in delivering development assistance to Afghanistan.\n\nOverall, the collaboration between the United Nations Country Team and the United Nations Working Group plays a crucial role in Afghanistan's development by ensuring the successful implementation of the UNDAF and facilitating operational changes for improved delivery of development assistance.",

Integrating energy efficiency practices to reduce losses across entire range of energy value chain starting from mining and extraction, transformation, transmission and distribution and end use sectors must become a priority for Afghanistan for long term sustainability of resources and providing access to clean energy for everyone. Energy efficiency in Afghanistan is regarded as an embryonic subject matter presently for policy makers as well as wider population, resulting in various levels of challenges in bringing about necessary changes in social and institutional landscape to carry out policy reforms related to energy efficiency.
