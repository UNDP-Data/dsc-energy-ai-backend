    "user_query": "How do governance and rule of law reforms compare between North Macedonia and Sri Lanka?",
    "answer": "Governance and rule of law reforms in North Macedonia and Sri Lanka differ in several aspects. \n\nIn North Macedonia, the country is working towards narrowing the income gap with the European Union (EU). They have a focus on European Union accession, sustainable economic growth, and inclusive prosperity. Additionally, North Macedonia has interconnectivity infrastructure with Albania, including the city of Manastir located within its borders.\n\nOn the other hand, in Sri Lanka, governance and rule of law reforms are centered around various strategies and events. The Ministry of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development is responsible for implementing steps to ensure the exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources are carried out with appropriate investor participation and internationally recognized practices. Sri Lanka also focuses on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aiming for equity and 'leaving no-one behind'. They have updated their Nationally Determined Contributions, committing to increasing forest cover, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and achieving carbon neutrality in electricity generation. Additionally, Sri Lanka ranks among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries on the Climate Risk Index.\n\nOverall, while North Macedonia's governance and rule of law reforms are more focused on EU integration and interconnectivity with neighboring countries, Sri Lanka's reforms are centered around sustainable development, climate resilience, and the responsible exploitation of petroleum resources.",
