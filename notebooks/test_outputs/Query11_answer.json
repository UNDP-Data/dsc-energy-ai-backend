    "answer": "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is implementing several strategies to support Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy (BERA). One of the strategies is through partnership and coordination mechanisms. UNDP, as a partner with the United Nations, will participate in joint Government-United Nations coordination mechanisms. This means that UNDP will work closely with BERA to align their efforts and collaborate on common goals.\n\nAdditionally, UNDP has established multi-stakeholder partnerships on priorities for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This implies that UNDP and BERA will work together to identify and prioritize the SDGs that are most relevant to Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy. By doing so, they can focus their efforts and resources on achieving these goals.\n\nFurthermore, UNDP will support the Government in driving policies and actions that focus on disaster risk reduction and increasing resilience. This support aims to reduce the long-term vulnerability of the population and protect development investments, particularly in at-risk areas. UNDP will also continue to support the Government in addressing structural and systemic barriers to gender equality and women's empowerment in policy formulation and implementation.\n\nIn terms of monitoring and evaluation, UNDP will employ national monitoring systems, official statistical data, and reports from line ministries, development partners, and research institutions to measure its contribution to national results. This means that UNDP, in collaboration with BERA, will monitor the progress and impact of their strategies and interventions to ensure they are effectively supporting Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy.\n\nOverall, UNDP is implementing strategies such as partnership and coordination mechanisms, multi-stakeholder partnerships for the SDGs, support for policy formulation and implementation, and monitoring and evaluation to support Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy. These strategies aim to strengthen governance, promote sustainable development, and address key challenges in Angola.",
