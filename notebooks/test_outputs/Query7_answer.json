    "answer": "Afghanistan is addressing the challenge of climate change and natural resource management through various initiatives and policies. One of the key documents outlining the country's approach is the Country Programme Document for Afghanistan (2015-2019) by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). This document highlights the importance of Afghanistan's \"Transformation Decade\" and its journey towards self-reliance, with a focus on political, security, and development processes.\n\nIn terms of renewable energy, Afghanistan has significant potential for utilizing renewable energy sources such as hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. The Renewable Energy Policy of Afghanistan emphasizes the need for rapid deployment of renewable energy projects to bring socio-economic benefits, employment opportunities, energy security, and access to energy. The government aims to produce around 318 GW of electricity using available renewable energy sources in the country. However, so far, only parts of hydroelectric power projects have been implemented.\n\nTo support the development of renewable energy, the government has established the Renewable Energy Coordination Committee (RECC) under the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). The RECC's mandate is to coordinate with relevant government and non-government entities for the implementation of renewable energy projects. Additionally, the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) has the authority to implement up to 1 MW of renewable energy projects.\n\nThe Afghanistan Rural Renewable Energy Policy focuses on providing energy access and energy security in rural areas. It promotes the establishment of Zonal Renewable Energy Centers (ZREC) within the Rural Energy Department (RED) for decentralized governance and coordination. The policy also emphasizes the expansion of rural energy and electricity services, as more than 75% of Afghans live in rural areas and 67% of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from rural areas.\n\nThe Afghanistan Energy Efficiency Policy aims to integrate energy efficiency practices across the entire energy value chain, starting from mining and extraction to end-use sectors. The policy recognizes the importance of energy efficiency for long-term sustainability and providing access to clean energy for everyone.\n\nOverall, Afghanistan's approach to addressing climate change and natural resource management involves the development and implementation of renewable energy policies, coordination committees, and a focus on rural energy expansion and energy efficiency. These initiatives aim to bring socio-economic benefits, employment opportunities, and access to clean energy while ensuring sustainable development and environmental sustainability.",
