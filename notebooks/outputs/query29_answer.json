    "user_query": "What are the challenges faced by Niger and Nigeria in achieving sustainable development and how are they addressing these challenges?",
    "answer": "Niger and Nigeria face several challenges in achieving sustainable development. In Nigeria, despite being the largest crude oil producer in Africa, poverty and unemployment rates are high. In 2019, the poverty rate was 40% (equivalent to 82.9 million people), and the unemployment rate was 33%. These challenges hinder the country's progress towards sustainable development.\n\nTo address these challenges, Nigeria has implemented various strategies. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is working within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework to support Nigeria's development goals. The country program document for Nigeria (2023-2027) outlines the priorities and partnerships for achieving sustainable development. It emphasizes the need for inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and job creation.\n\nAdditionally, Nigeria has a National Gas Policy that aims to utilize the country's natural gas resources for socio-economic development. The policy sets medium to long-term targets for gas reserves growth and utilization. It recognizes the challenges facing Nigeria, such as the need for infrastructure development and the promotion of gas-based industries. By implementing this policy, Nigeria aims to address these challenges and leverage its gas resources for sustainable development.\n\nFurthermore, Nigeria is also focusing on renewable energy as part of its sustainable development efforts. The country has seen growth in renewable energy supply, with renewables accounting for 76% of the total energy supply in 2020. The Renewable Energy Roadmap for Nigeria, developed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), provides a strategic plan for increasing the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix. This roadmap outlines the necessary steps to promote renewable energy deployment and highlights the potential benefits for Nigeria's sustainable development.\n\nIn summary, Niger and Nigeria face challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and the need for infrastructure development in achieving sustainable development. However, they are addressing these challenges through initiatives such as the UNDP country program, the National Gas Policy, and the Renewable Energy Roadmap. These efforts aim to promote inclusive growth, utilize natural resources, and increase the share of renewable energy for sustainable development.",
