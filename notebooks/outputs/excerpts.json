The renewable energy share in Albania is predominantly hydropower of which accounts for 95% of all generating capacity, with the remaining divided between solar (1%) and crude oil (4%). The remaining share of supply comes from imports making Albania a net energy importer and thus heavily reliant on imports. Being also heavily reliant on hydropower also means that renewable generation is sensitive to rainfall, of which has seen considerable annual variations and a steady decline in recent years. This is likely to further decline with",
