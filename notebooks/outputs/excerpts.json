        "summary": "Access to electricity in rural areas of Zimbabwe has increased over the years, but access in urban areas has remained constant. The share of the population with access to clean fuels for cooking has declined. Economic and political instability have hindered efforts to improve energy access. The country's electricity supply comes from coal, hydropower, and imported sources. There is potential for solar power, but only small-scale projects are currently operational. Biomass accounts for a significant portion of household energy. The mining and industrial sectors are the largest consumers of energy, followed by the domestic and commercial sectors. Energy needs of public institutions, such as healthcare facilities and schools, are not being met. The government has implemented energy policies to increase access to modern energy and promote renewable energy sources. However, there are weak linkages between energy policies and other sectors such as health, climate, forestry, and gender. The government has unbundled the Zimbabwe Electric Supply Authority (ZESA) and established the Rural Electrification Authority to expand the national grid to rural areas. The energy sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Zimbabwe. Data on energy in Zimbabwe is available from various sources, but the number of publications on energy has historically been low.\n\nThe government of Zimbabwe is integrating climate change issues into projects addressing the water-energy nexus. The Energy and Environment Partnership Trust Fund (EEP Africa) has implemented various projects in Zimbabwe, including solar pumps for irrigation and solar home systems. Non-governmental organizations and private sector firms are also working to improve energy access in the country. The government has developed a National Climate Policy to manage climate change risks and integrate climate change issues with other sectors such as energy, gender, forests, and health. The public utility companies ZESA and REA are responsible for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in Zimbabwe. Bilateral and multilateral aid organizations provide funding and implement projects to improve energy access in the country. The energy sector in Zimbabwe is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with a high reliance on coal burning for electricity generation. The country is vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as droughts and reduced water supply for hydropower. Biomass, primarily firewood, is the primary source of energy in Zimbabwe, but its use contributes to deforestation and air pollution. The country faces energy poverty and challenges in meeting the growing demand for energy.",

        "summary": "The article discusses the concept of the Just Transition and its relevance to Africa. It highlights the challenges and complexities of implementing just transition initiatives in Africa, including the high rates of unemployment, informal labor, and external forces that perpetuate inequality. The article also explores different streams of the Just Transition movement, such as the Just Energy Transition, Just Rural Transition, Just Urban Transition, and Just Circular Economy Transition. It provides examples of initiatives in each stream and emphasizes the need for community-driven visions and definitions. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of consensus-building at the local and national level and the need for more climate financing dedicated to African-led initiatives.\n\nFarmers in Africa, particularly smallholder farmers, face challenges due to volatile commodity prices and lack of bargaining power. Initiatives like the Living Income Differential (LID) in the cocoa industry have not been effective in protecting farmers' incomes. Climate-induced declines in crop production further exacerbate the situation. The Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) may expose smallholder farmers to increased competition without access to markets or value-addition opportunities. Just Transition initiatives in Africa need to consider the interlinkages between rural and urban areas, as well as the potential for clean energy technologies in agriculture. However, there are challenges in implementing Just Transition in Africa, including funding constraints, administrative issues, and the need for consensus-building at the local and national levels. The African context requires specific programmatic and political considerations, including the inclusion of marginalized voices and the avoidance of reinforcing inequalities.\n\nThe Ministry Conference for 2022 will take place from November 11th to 13th.",

        "summary": "IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency, has published a report titled \"Scenarios for the Energy Transition: Experience and Good Practices in Africa.\" The report highlights the experiences and best practices of nine African countries in developing long-term energy scenarios for their energy transition plans. These countries include Botswana, Egypt, Eswatini, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tunisia. The report emphasizes the importance of establishing strong governance structures, expanding the boundaries of scenarios to include social and environmental aspects, improving scenario use for decision-making, and identifying capacity-building approaches. The countries showcased in the report have demonstrated effective collaboration among government institutions, private sector stakeholders, and international organizations in developing and implementing their energy transition plans. The report also emphasizes the need for transparent and effective communication with stakeholders and the public to build trust and ensure accountability in the energy planning process. Overall, the report provides valuable insights and lessons learned from African countries in their efforts to transition to sustainable energy systems.\n\nThe Arab region is improving scenario use and capacity-building approaches in energy planning. Egypt communicates energy scenarios through workshops and media, and is restructuring entities for integrated information systems. Egypt is also transitioning from outsourcing skills to building in-house capacity. Eswatini has a strong governance structure for energy planning and collaborates with international organizations for capacity building. Morocco has a participative process for scenario development and uses an integrated modeling approach. Nigeria has a solid governance structure and updates its energy plans frequently. South Africa develops its Integrated Resource Plan through extensive consultation and collaboration with the CSIR.\n\nExtensive consultation with academia, transmission network, system operators, government, and industry is necessary for developing energy scenarios. This participative approach helps identify errors, build trust among stakeholders, and ensure acceptance of outcomes. The South African Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) has evolved over the years through public consultation and stakeholder input. The IRP evaluates the implications of high deployment of renewable energy and aims to decrease the contribution of coal-fired power plants. Tunisia's energy planning is guided by its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the National Low Carbon Strategy. The country collaborates with international partners to strengthen energy scenarios development and capacity building. The Eastern African Power Pool (EAPP), West African Power Pool (WAPP), and Mediterranean Transmission System Operator (Med-TSO) use bottom-up approaches and establish strong governance structures for scenario development. They also focus on transparent communication and capacity building in energy planning.\n\nIRENA's Power Pool, ECOWAPP, was accessed on 11 July 2022.",

        "summary": "The Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) aims to accelerate the growth of voluntary carbon markets in Africa. ACMI is led by a steering committee of influential African leaders and carbon market experts. The initiative aims to scale the supply and demand of high integrity African carbon credits to drive climate action and create jobs. ACMI proposes a roadmap of 13 action programs across the value chain of voluntary carbon markets, including project development, intermediation, financing, and integrity. The initiative also emphasizes the importance of transparency, equity, and benefits-sharing in carbon credit projects. ACMI aims to support African governments, communities, project developers, and other stakeholders in realizing the potential of carbon markets for sustainable development in Africa.\n\nThe voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) are experiencing steady growth globally, driven by increasing demand and expanding markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. The demand for VCMs is expected to grow 15 times by 2030, fueled by corporate net zero commitments and the availability of point-of-sale offsetting. Voluntary carbon credits can be generated from various project types, including forestry, agriculture, renewable energy, waste management, and engineered carbon dioxide removal. However, there are challenges to scaling voluntary carbon markets in Africa, including limited project diversification, regulatory complexities, high upfront costs, and a lack of local validation and verification bodies. ACMI aims to address these challenges and build the foundations for a thriving voluntary carbon market ecosystem in Africa by 2030. The initiative's ambition includes growing African credit retirements, creating jobs, raising the quality and integrity of African credits, and ensuring equitable distribution of carbon credit revenue. ACMI plans to achieve these goals through various actions, such as developing country-specific carbon market activation plans, promoting African carbon credits, and deploying financing mechanisms to de-risk investment.\n\nACMI proposes several actions to promote the development of voluntary carbon markets in Africa. These actions include:\n\n1. Developing voluntary carbon market activation plans at the country level, setting ambition, integrating carbon markets into climate plans, and aligning governance structures.\n\n2. Clarifying regulations to create an enabling environment for carbon market development, including ownership rights, registration of carbon credits, emissions reporting, and fiscal policies.\n\n3. Setting concrete targets for carbon credit volume and sustainable development, and developing demand incentives such as carbon taxes.\n\n4. Strengthening governance structures and coordination mechanisms between governmental units and national entities.\n\n5. Building capacity and providing technical assistance to project developers, validation/verification bodies, and other stakeholders.\n\n6. Supporting the development of micro-carbon credit generation models involving smallholder farmers, including aggregation, technology use, and market platforms.\n\n7. Enhancing monitoring, reporting, validation, and verification activities by scaling up capacity, developing local VVBs, and adapting methodologies to the African context.\n\n8. Promoting the quality, equity, and marketing of differentiated African carbon credits to both African and global buyers through exchanges and reducing reliance on intermediaries.\n\nThese actions aim to address challenges and promote the growth of voluntary carbon markets in Africa, unlocking the potential for climate projects and attracting international climate finance.\n\nACMI proposes to engage with standards organizations to establish clear certification pathways for distributed renewable energy (DRE) projects in Africa. This will help clarify the requirements and eligibility criteria for certifying DRE projects for carbon credit generation.\n\nAdvocate for the inclusion of DRE projects in international compliance markets: ACMI will work to raise awareness and engage with decision-makers to advocate for the acceptance of DRE projects in international compliance markets. This will help create demand for DRE projects and provide additional revenue streams for project developers.\n\nSupport pilot projects and methodologies for decarbonization opportunities in Africa: ACMI will encourage the development of new project types and methodologies that are relevant to decarbonization opportunities in Africa. This includes projects in sectors such as renewable energy, waste management, engineered carbon dioxide removals, transport, agriculture, and more. By piloting these projects, ACMI aims to demonstrate their feasibility and potential for carbon credit generation.\n\nOverall, these actions aim to diversify the types of carbon credit projects in Africa and capture specific decarbonization opportunities on the continent. This will help unlock the full potential of Africa's carbon credit market and contribute to global climate action.\n\nACMI aims to develop voluntary carbon markets in Africa through various action programs. These programs include mobilizing project developers, promoting financing mechanisms, ensuring quality and integrity, and advocating for increased demand for African carbon credits. ACMI also plans to collaborate with governments, stakeholders, and standards organizations to support the development of carbon projects in Africa. The goal is to grow African carbon credit retirements to ~300 MtCO2e by 2030 while ensuring equitable distribution of revenue and job creation. ACMI will refine its roadmap and seek endorsements and support from partners to achieve its objectives.\n\nThe Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) released a roadmap report in November 2022, which highlights the importance of preserving extensive, ecologically intact forests and reducing deforestation rates in Africa.",

        "summary": "The justice and policy implications of clean energy transition in Africa are explored in this paper. Africa is considered a key player in the global energy transition due to its large supply of fossil fuels and critical minerals for renewable energy components. However, it is important to ensure that the transition is just and inclusive, leaving no one behind. Many clean energy projects in Africa have economic, environmental, and social implications that can jeopardize the wellbeing of vulnerable communities. Policy implications for a just transition in Africa are discussed, including the need to address energy security, economic growth, and affordable access. Incremental transition emphasizing low-carbon development is seen as the most feasible approach. The paper also highlights the importance of considering justice, gender equality, human rights, and sustainable development goals in the clean energy transition.\n\nEnergy poverty is a significant challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, with many schools lacking access to electricity. This limits students' and teachers' ability to access educational resources and materials. Access to electricity supports education by improving household incomes and affordability of tuition. Lack of electricity also hinders vocational training and specialized classes. Efforts to increase access to electricity, such as through private investments and renewable energy technologies, have shown positive impacts on school enrollment and performance.\n\nAccess to clean water and sustainable sanitation practices is another critical challenge in many African countries. Lack of access to these basic services has serious consequences for public health, economic development, and food security. Climate change exacerbates the water scarcity issue. Sustainable energy approaches, such as renewable energy technologies, can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges and improving access to clean water and sanitation for all.\n\nEnergy is essential for economic growth and employment. Reliable energy is necessary for industries to reach their production capacity. Lack of reliable electricity leads to output losses and hinders economic growth. Access to electricity and renewable energy sources can stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities. Countries that have expanded their electricity generation capacity have experienced significant industrialization and economic development.\n\nResilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and innovation are crucial for economic development. Reliable energy policies and planning are essential for effective and sustainable industrial and innovation strategies. Energy plays a key role in industrialization and fostering innovation. Countries that have prioritized renewable energy sources and implemented initiatives to increase access to electricity have seen significant industrial growth and development.\n\nTaking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts is a global concern. Electrification and renewable energy production are recommended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. African countries, such as Morocco and Egypt, have set ambitious goals to increase their usage of renewable energy sources. Transitioning to clean energy is crucial for mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nAchieving a just and inclusive energy transition in Africa requires comprehensive policies that consider the needs of vulnerable and marginalized groups. It is important to prioritize the expansion of energy generation capacity and promote renewable energy sources to create conditions for economic growth and prosperity. The transition to clean energy should be equitable and inclusive, benefiting all members of society.\n\nThe article \"Real Change in Environmental Science\" by Nsafon et al. discusses the latest developments in the field of environmental science.",

It highlights the challenges faced by women in accessing and succeeding in clean energy careers, including limited awareness of opportunities, educational disparities, biases in hiring processes, unattractive job features, unsupportive workplaces, and social norms and biases. The report also provides recommendations for addressing these challenges, such as promoting gender-inclusive job advertisements, engaging men in the workplace, using diverse outreach channels, removing gendered language from job descriptions, implementing blind hiring practices, and improving workplace features to support women. The report emphasizes the importance of gender equity in the clean energy sector for economic growth, poverty reduction, women's empowerment, and skills development. It also acknowledges the efforts of donors and companies in promoting women's inclusion in the sector. The report includes insights from interviews with women workers in the clean energy sector, highlighting their experiences and perspectives.\n\nWomen in the clean energy sector in Africa are motivated by the opportunity to make a positive impact on the world and improve their communities. Explicitly appealing to these motivations in job advertisements can help attract more women to the sector. Bias in hiring may be difficult to observe, but proactive efforts to include women in advertisements can help increase the female applicant pool. Companies can also counter biases in hiring by altering interview processes to ensure equal treatment of men and women. However, there is still work to be done in shifting mindsets and addressing discrimination against women. Women in the sector face challenges such as unattractive job features, including long hours, relocation, and extensive field travel. Commission-based roles can leave women feeling uncertain and unsupported. Companies need to address these challenges to attract and retain more women in the sector. Efforts to support women at work, such as updating maternity leave policies and promoting diversity in leadership, are important for creating inclusive and supportive workplaces. Confidence gaps and social norms can hold women back from pursuing clean energy careers, but many women in the sector are confident and ambitious. Companies can leverage the ambition and confidence of women to drive positive change. Overall, companies can make significant progress in attracting and promoting women in the clean energy sector, but there is still work to be done at both the company and ecosystem levels to address gender disparities.\n\nThe contact email for Shortlistnet is programs@shortlistnet.",

        "summary": "This report explores the potential for ending energy poverty through the use of distributed renewable energy technologies (DREs). It estimates that approximately 1 billion people still live in energy poverty, and investing $130 billion per year in DREs over the next decade could create 25 million new jobs in the power sector and another 500 million jobs in agriculture, healthcare, education, and small and medium-sized enterprises. The report highlights the cost-effectiveness and climate benefits of DREs compared to fossil fuels. It also emphasizes the importance of targeting vulnerable communities and advancing gender inclusion through DRE deployment. The report includes case studies on the potential of solar irrigation in Ethiopia and the success of SunCulture in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nInvesting in distributed renewable energy (DRE) has the potential to create millions of direct and downstream jobs, particularly in developing countries. In total, around 25 million direct jobs are created, with an additional 500 million new jobs and 700 million improved jobs in downstream sectors. DRE projects create more direct jobs compared to investments in centralized fossil fuel assets. The jobs created are predominantly low-skilled, providing opportunities for vulnerable groups and sectors affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. DRE also has the potential to advance gender inclusion and create enterprise opportunities for women. Specific interventions and investments are needed to ensure effective use of electricity for productive purposes. The report highlights case studies in Nigeria and Uganda, demonstrating the job creation potential and benefits of DRE in sectors such as fishery, milk production, and agriculture. To capture these benefits, increased investment in DRE is necessary, reaching $130 billion per year in 63 energy-poor countries in Asia and Africa. This investment can help end energy poverty, reduce CO2 emissions, and drive economic recovery and sustainable development.\n\nThe text discusses the transformation of agricultural value chains and provides a link to the Rockefeller Foundation's initiative to improve the lives of billions of people.",

        "summary": "DNV GL conducted a wind resource mapping project in Zambia under the Renewable Energy Resource Mapping and Geospatial Planning initiative. The project involved collecting wind data at eight sites across Zambia and analyzing the wind regime and energy production potential. The measurements were taken from November 2016 to January 2018, and the data coverage was between 95% and 100%. The analysis included evaluating the long-term wind regime, estimating energy production for preliminary wind farms, and assessing uncertainties. The results showed that there is wind energy potential in various locations across Zambia. However, there is a need for further feasibility analysis and consideration of turbine technology suitability for each site. The report also highlighted the importance of using taller met masts or remote sensing to reduce uncertainties in wind speed extrapolation. Overall, the project aimed to provide accurate information on the national wind resource to support wind energy development in Zambia.\n\nThe wind speed frequency distributions measured by the site masts in Zambia do not exhibit a standard Weibull shape. This should be taken into consideration when modeling energy production at proposed sites, as it could lead to inaccuracies in energy production estimates. The wind regime across the sites was predicted using industry standard wind flow modeling software. The average extrapolation distances range from km to km. The use of CFD wind flow modeling is recommended for further wind assessment studies in Zambia. The power curve used in the analysis is a generic model, and a thorough market review of available technologies is recommended. The results of the energy production estimates are provided in tables, and the uncertainty in the analysis is driven by spatial and vertical extrapolation. The wind data statistics for each site are presented in the appendix. Overall, the data collected from the met masts in Zambia is considered good, and further investment in measurement campaigns and feasibility analysis is recommended to reduce uncertainties in future wind development.\n\nThe text provides information on wind speed and energy production for different locations and months. It includes turbine layouts, monthly and diurnal production profiles, and data sources used for analysis.\n\nThe text contains data on energy production for different sites and months, as well as information on turbulence intensity and uncertainty analysis.\n\nWe offer certification services to customers in various industries worldwide. With a team of 16,000 professionals, we aim to assist our customers in creating a safer, smarter, and greener world.",

        "summary": "IRENA's brief on finding common ground for a just energy transition highlights the importance of including labor unions and employers in shaping the transition. The brief emphasizes the need for inclusive and participatory approaches, tailored strategies for different regions, and the creation of decent jobs. It also emphasizes the importance of social dialogue, fundamental labor rights, skills development, workforce diversity, and mobilizing finance for a just energy transition. The brief provides examples of best practices and calls for stronger consensus, local value creation, adherence to international labor standards, and adequate funding for implementing just transition strategies. The brief also highlights the importance of addressing energy access and the socio-economic implications of the transition in developing countries.\n\nCommunities gaining energy access for the first time should consider the close link between energy access, livelihoods, and community services such as healthcare and education. Traditional approaches to energy access have focused on techno-economic solutions without fully considering community needs and aspirations. A systemic approach is necessary that prioritizes the diversity of people's livelihoods and aspirations and delivers tailored energy solutions, financing, capacity building, market access, and policy support. This approach can lead to strong long-term socio-economic benefits and contribute to multiple Sustainable Development Goals. The impact of the energy transition on social inequality is complex and depends on factors such as policy design, local circumstances, and selected technologies. Low-income households are disproportionately affected by energy price increases, which can lead to increased poverty and unequal access to employment opportunities. A just energy transition must address income and energy inequality simultaneously. The richest households are responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need for equitable action. Holistic policy frameworks are needed to address multiple challenges and opportunities in the energy transition. These frameworks should include deployment policies, integrating policies, enabling policies, and structural change and just transition policies. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance aims to facilitate the managed phase-out of oil and gas production. The resilience of existing energy infrastructure should be considered in the face of accelerating climate change impacts. Many economies are dependent on fossil fuel production and exports, making it challenging to transition away from fossil fuels. The dominant economic model of growth, deregulation, and linear resource use may not be optimal for achieving climate objectives and a just energy transition. New development models compatible with climate, ecological, and social sustainability should be explored. Workforce development is essential for the energy transition and should be addressed through comprehensive policy frameworks. This includes industrial policies, education and skills training, labor market policies, enterprise development, diversity and inclusion strategies, regional revitalization, and social protection measures. Efforts should be made to ensure that workforce development is inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of educational level, socio-economic background, ethnicity, or gender. Women are underrepresented in the energy sector, particularly in STEM positions and senior management roles. Efforts should be made to promote gender equality and create opportunities for women in the energy sector. Youth should be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary for a climate-safe future. Early education should create awareness and motivation, and later years should focus on teaching the necessary skills. There is a need to address the mismatch between courses being taught and the skills needed in the renewable energy sector.\n\nThe Energy Transition Education Network was established to prepare educators to teach renewable energy to students. The network provides tools and innovative practices for integrating renewable energy into teaching. Iberdrola and UNICEF have formed an alliance to train and employ young people in vulnerable situations in the green economy. The energy transition must consider the needs of ethnic minorities and indigenous communities, who often work in dangerous fossil fuel industries. Just transition policies should address social and economic implications and ensure fair allocation of burdens and benefits. Public funds are needed to support the energy transition and should be used to create an enabling environment for private investment. International collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial for a successful energy transition. Recommendations include building consensus among stakeholders, creating holistic policy frameworks, involving workers in decision-making, focusing on job quality, and customizing action strategies by country. The transition should also consider the needs of communities and promote diversity in the workforce. Adequate finance is essential for a just and inclusive energy transition.\n\nThe Climate Inequality Report for 2023 can be accessed through the provided link.",
