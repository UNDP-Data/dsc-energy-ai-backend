        "extract": "MESSAGE OF THE SECRETARY The 2018-2040 Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) is the second energy plan in support of the government’s AmBisyon Natin 2040 platform. The Plan seeks to uplift the well-being of all Filipinos by securing access to reliable and affordable energy services and technologies. It also looks at enforceable policies and feasible programs to support the government’s goal of achieving inclusive growth for all. Energy and power have become an indispensable need in our modern world. Advances in technological innovations have made demand for energy more compelling. And to meet that basic need, the DOE is tasked to deliver its mandate of ensuring that energy is readily available to make lives comfortable and our businesses competitive. However, the complex energy challenges facing us today require long-term strategies, strong collaboration, and firm decision-making to achieve realistic and long-term solutions to the increasing energy demands of the country. Thus, this PEP outlines the energy priorities that are innovative, sustainable, and clean.",

It is in this light that the Department of Energy remains firm and resolute to aggressively pursue the energy agenda focused on enhancing the country’s access to energy. This is instrumental in reducing poverty as well as promoting social equity. The development of indigenous energy resources is critical in achieving greater energy supply security for the country. Likewise, the implementation of relevant energy reforms will encourage more investors to engage in energy projects in a business-friendly environment. The trickle-down effect is a wider range of economic opportunities in the countryside.
