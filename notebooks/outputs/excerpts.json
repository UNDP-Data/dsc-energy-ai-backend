        "summary": "UNDP AlbaniaThe Government of Japan has partnered with UNDP In Albania to accelerate the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Action Plan towards achieving the overall enhanced target and climate-resilient development, in response to the climate emergency.A new project “Market transformation for solar power Photovoltaic acceleration in Albania” funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) with an amount of USD 859,000 USD and implemented by UNDP in Albania aims to assist the country to implement the new national target in response to Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The project aims to support the transition process towards diversification from hydropower and promote alternative sources of renewable energy by 2030, 42% of renewable energy (rather than large hydro) in gross final energy consumption”.The project will work to remove the market barriers and accelerate the development of solar PV (reaching an additional installed capacity of 1000 kW) by enabling the required policy framework, availability of financing mechanisms, ensuring the supply of reliable",
