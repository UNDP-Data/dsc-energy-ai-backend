            "summary": "The article discusses the concept of the Just Transition and its relevance to Africa. It highlights the challenges and complexities of implementing just transition initiatives in Africa, including the high rates of unemployment, informal labor, and external forces that perpetuate inequality. The article also explores different streams of the Just Transition movement, such as the Just Energy Transition, Just Rural Transition, Just Urban Transition, and Just Circular Economy Transition. It provides examples of initiatives in each stream and emphasizes the need for community-driven visions and definitions. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of consensus-building at the local and national level and the need for more climate financing dedicated to African-led initiatives.\n\nFarmers in Africa, particularly smallholder farmers, face challenges due to volatile commodity prices and lack of bargaining power. Initiatives like the Living Income Differential (LID) in the cocoa industry have not been effective in protecting farmers' incomes. Climate-induced declines in crop production further exacerbate the situation. The Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) may expose smallholder farmers to increased competition without access to markets or value-addition opportunities. Just Transition initiatives in Africa need to consider the interlinkages between rural and urban areas, as well as the potential for clean energy technologies in agriculture. However, there are challenges in implementing Just Transition in Africa, including funding constraints, administrative issues, and the need for consensus-building at the local and national levels. The African context requires specific programmatic and political considerations, including the inclusion of marginalized voices and the avoidance of reinforcing inequalities.\n\nThe Ministry Conference for 2022 will take place from November 11th to 13th.",

            "summary": "The Energy Progress Report 2022, jointly produced by the United Nations Statistics Division, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank, and other custodian agencies, assesses global progress towards achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. The report highlights that while there has been some progress, particularly in access to electricity, the world is still not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 7 targets by 2030. The report emphasizes the need for increased efforts and investments to accelerate progress, especially in the most vulnerable countries. It also calls for greater support from international actors to expand access to clean energy and improve energy efficiency. The report provides updated data and indicators to track progress across different energy targets and highlights the importance of reliable and high-quality data for informed policymaking.\n\nThe global access to electricity has increased from 83% in 2010 to 91% in 2020, but the pace of progress has slowed in recent years. To achieve universal electricity access by 2030, the annual growth rate in global electrification needs to increase. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest access deficit, with 77% of the global population without access to electricity. Rural areas have larger access deficits than urban areas, but rural electrification has been faster than urban electrification over the past decade. The top 20 countries with the largest access deficits are mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Decentralized renewable energy solutions have tripled since 2010, reaching 39 million people in 2019. Affordability of electricity remains a challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries in Asia. Tailored end-user financing is needed to expand and maintain household electricity connections.\n\nThe global population with access to electricity increased from 83% in 2010 to 91% in 2020. However, 733 million people still lack access to electricity. The main challenges in achieving universal access are bringing service to vulnerable and poor populations. Between 2010 and 2020, 1 billion people gained access to electricity, with the fastest progress in Latin America and the Caribbean. Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest proportion of the unelectrified population. The urban access rate is 97%, while the rural access rate is 83%. Decentralized renewable energy solutions, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, have provided access to electricity for 39 million people. The top 20 access-deficit countries, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, account for 76% of the global population without access to electricity. Kenya and Uganda have made the greatest progress in increasing access, while Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo have seen slower progress. The least-electrified countries are all in Sub-Saharan Africa, with South Sudan having the lowest access rate. Rwanda and Uganda have made significant progress in increasing access.\n\nIn 2020, 69% of the global population had access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, an increase of almost 70 million people compared to previous years. However, about a third of the global population still lacked access to clean cooking. Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased by only 12 percentage points over the past decade. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people without access is increasing at an accelerating rate. Achieving universal access to clean cooking is impossible without addressing the growing access deficit in this region. Central Asia and Southern Asia saw the most progress in increasing access to clean cooking, while Latin America and the Caribbean remained stagnant. By 2030, access to clean cooking is projected to reach 80-90% in Central Asia, Southern Asia, Eastern Asia, and South-eastern Asia.\n\nAccess to clean cooking fuels and technologies remains low in Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, with only about one in five people in Sub-Saharan Africa having access. The urban-rural divide in access is significant, with 86% of people in urban areas having access compared to only 48% in rural areas. The 20 countries with the largest access deficits account for more than 80% of the global population without access, and little progress has been made in most of these countries. The use of gaseous fuels for cooking has increased globally, overtaking biomass as the dominant cooking fuel. The use of electricity for cooking has also increased, particularly in urban areas. However, the use of kerosene remains notable in urban areas of low- and middle-income countries in Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa. Closing the access gap in Sub-Saharan Africa requires increased public and private finance, as current investment falls far short of what is needed. Accelerating access to clean cooking is critical for reducing vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing gender inequity. The negative impacts of the lack of access to clean cooking, including health, gender, and climate impacts, are estimated to cost trillions of dollars annually. Policy interventions are needed to prioritize clean cooking, tackle cost and finance barriers, bolster sustainability and supply chains, and create awareness about impacts and solutions.\n\nEcuador is shifting subsidies away from LPG to renewable electricity. Nepal is promoting the use of electricity for cooking to reduce reliance on LPG imports. Achieving universal access to clean cooking would cost $1 trillion over 10 years. Strategic policies and incentives are needed to accelerate progress in clean cooking access, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Tools and resources are available to help countries design clean cooking programs. Efforts are being made to transition refugee camps to clean cooking fuels. The share of renewable energy in global energy consumption increased slightly in 2019. Renewable electricity has the largest share among the end-use categories. Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest share of renewable energy, but traditional biomass is still widely used. Latin America and the Caribbean have the highest share of modern renewables. The share of renewables in energy consumption varies widely among countries. Brazil and Canada have the highest shares of modern renewables among the top 20 energy consuming countries.\n\nRenewable energy consumption in transport grew in 2019, with biofuels and renewable electricity being the main sources. However, the share of renewables in total energy consumed for transport only increased slightly. The United States, Brazil, and Europe accounted for the majority of renewable energy used in transport, with biofuels being the dominant source. China and India also saw significant growth in renewable energy consumption for transport, primarily driven by renewable electricity. To further increase the share of renewables in transport, a combination of policies supporting biofuels, nonbiogenic renewable fuels, transport electrification, renewable electricity generation, and active mobility is needed.\n\nGlobal energy intensity has improved since 1990, with a 16% decrease between 2010 and 2019. However, the rate of improvement has slowed in recent years, and it is below the target set under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Eastern Asia and Southeastern Asia achieved the highest improvement in energy intensity, while Latin America and the Caribbean had the lowest improvement. Among the top 20 energy-consuming countries, China has the fastest rate of improvement in energy intensity, followed by the United Kingdom. The freight transport sector experienced the highest improvement in energy intensity, while the residential buildings sector had the lowest improvement. The rising share of renewables in electricity generation has contributed to improved energy intensity. Digitalization is seen as a key factor in accelerating progress towards SDG and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nEnergy efficiency measures can have the greatest impact and benefit by focusing on areas such as building management systems, smart home technologies, and digitalization. These measures can significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings and households. Digitalization also offers system-wide benefits, including increased reliability, operational efficiency, and cost reductions. It can also support economic and social development, such as bringing clean energy solutions to marginalized communities. Additionally, energy efficiency policies should be strengthened and investment in energy efficiency measures should be scaled up to meet the targets of sustainable development goals.\n\nThe text discusses various measures of energy intensity, including the ratio between industry total final energy consumption (TFEC) and industry value-added, the ratio between total energy supply (TES) and gross domestic product (GDP), and the energy intensity of different sectors such as services, agriculture, passenger transport, and freight transport. It also mentions the efficiency of fossil fuel electricity generation and power transmission and distribution losses. Data sources include the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Development Indicators (WDI) database.\n\nThe text discusses various energy intensity ratios, including those related to electricity losses, electricity output, agriculture, passenger transport, freight transport, residential energy consumption, and fossil fuel electricity generation efficiency. The data sources for these ratios are mentioned as IEA Energy Balances and WDI.\n\nInternational public financial flows to support clean energy in developing countries declined by 23% in 2019 compared to 2018. The total amount of funding, $14 billion, was less than half of the peak in 2017. Hydropower received the largest share of commitments at 26%, followed by solar energy at 21% and wind energy at 12%. The majority of commitments were directed to 22 countries, with Nigeria, Guinea, and India receiving the most funding. Least-developed countries received 7% of commitments, but the amount decreased from the previous year. The mix of financial instruments supporting clean energy is changing, with a decrease in debt instruments and an increase in grants. Overall, international public financial flows for clean energy remain far below what is needed to achieve SDG 7.\n\nInternational public financial flows to developing countries for clean energy have been misclassified in some cases, leading to inaccurate reporting. Solar rooftop programs, for example, have been classified as solar energy commitments in the OECD's Creditor Reporting System. It is important to ensure that investments are accurately classified under the right technologies. Over the past decade, commitments to clean energy in developing countries have increased significantly, reaching almost triple the value in 2019 compared to 2010. However, there was a decrease in the five-year moving average of international public financial flows in 2019, indicating a slowdown in international public flows. The impacts of COVID-19 are likely to further depress international public flows in the future. The distribution of flows by technology shows that hydropower attracted the largest share of commitments, followed by solar energy and wind energy. Non-renewable energy still received a significant amount of public financial flows, highlighting the need for donors to redirect their investments towards renewables. Geographically, Sub-Saharan Africa received the largest flows, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states received a fairer distribution of flows compared to other developing countries. The distribution of flows by financial instrument shows a shift towards grants and equity, while the share of debt instruments has decreased. Concessional loans, grants, equity, and guarantees are important instruments for supporting clean energy projects in developing countries. However, there is a need to ensure that concessional loans do not lead to unsustainable external debt. The distribution of flows by country shows that Nigeria, Guinea, and India were the top recipients of international public financial flows in 2019. Least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states received a larger share of flows compared to other developing countries. However, there is still a need to improve the distribution of flows to reach those furthest behind. Overall, there is a need for increased investments in clean energy in developing countries, especially in the least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states. Donors should consider immediate changes to their investment strategies to redirect public flows from non-renewables to renewables.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has slowed global progress on SDG 7, particularly in the areas of universal access to clean cooking and electricity, and energy efficiency. However, progress in renewable energy has been consistently made throughout the pandemic. New policies and commitments from governments, as well as the outcomes of COP26, have improved the outlook for achieving SDG 7. However, access setbacks caused by the pandemic have outweighed the progress in access, particularly in developing economies.\n\nThe Stated Policies Scenario and Planned Energy Scenario depict the trajectory for achieving the targets set forth in SDG 7. The Stated Policies Scenario projects that 670 million people will still lack access to electricity in 2030, with Sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected region. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed progress on reaching universal access to electricity, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The outlook for access to clean cooking solutions is also concerning, with over 3 billion people projected to rely on traditional uses of biomass, kerosene, or coal for cooking in 2030. The use of renewables in the energy sector is growing, with solar PV and wind accounting for most of the growth in renewables-based electricity generation by 2030. However, current policies are insufficient to meet the goals agreed to under the Paris Agreement and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Increased investment in clean energy is needed to bridge the gap and achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030.\n\nThe global energy transition requires the decarbonization of the electricity sector by mid-century, with a rapid increase in renewable energy generation and the electrification of heat and transport applications. This transition can be achieved through the deployment of various renewable power technologies, along with increased flexibility in the power sector. Direct uses of renewables, such as bioenergy and solar thermal, are also important in sectors like transport, buildings, and industry. The transition to clean energy requires significant investments, with an average annual investment of trillions of dollars needed to achieve the SDG targets. Improvements in energy efficiency are also crucial, with the need to double the global rate of improvement by 2030. International cooperation and support for clean energy research and technology are essential for achieving the SDG targets. The energy transition has positive socioeconomic impacts, including increased GDP, job creation, and improved welfare. Reliable and comprehensive energy data collection is crucial for tracking progress and making evidence-based decisions.\n\nAccess to electricity rates vary across countries and regions. Some countries, such as Albania, Algeria, and Argentina, have achieved near-universal access to electricity, with rates of 99-100% in both urban and rural areas. Other countries, like Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, and Chad, have much lower access rates, ranging from 11-41%. In some cases, there are significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with higher access rates in urban areas. For example, in Eswatini, the access rate is 80% overall, but only 35% in rural areas. Overall, progress has been made in increasing access to electricity globally, but there is still work to be done to ensure universal access for all.\n\nThe text provides data on the percentage of final energy consumption from renewable sources for various countries. It includes information on the share of renewable energy, such as solid biofuels, liquid biofuels, biogases, hydro, tide, wind, solar, geothermal, municipal waste, electricity consumption, heat raising, and transport.\n\nThe text provides information on various countries' energy consumption, renewable energy consumption, and installed renewable electricity-generating capacity. It also includes data on international financial flows to support clean energy in developing countries. The information is presented in a tabular format, with data for different years.\n\nThe text provides data on energy progress in different regions and countries. It mentions the regions of Southern Asia, Eastern Asia and South-eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Asia and Northern Africa, Oceania excluding Australia and New Zealand, as well as specific groups such as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). It also mentions the availability of data and reports on the SDG Tracking website, and acknowledges the organizations involved in producing the Energy Progress Report.",

            "summary": "This report discusses the benefits, challenges, and solutions related to the interoperability of distributed energy resources (DERs). DERs, such as solar PV, electric vehicles, and battery storage, play a crucial role in the energy transition and offer various benefits to consumers, including lower energy bills and access to backup power. However, limited interoperability between DER devices and the grid can hinder their full potential. Interoperability challenges range from minor inconveniences to more significant issues that prevent the realization of specific DER functions. Manufacturers are often hesitant to develop interoperable solutions due to cybersecurity concerns and added costs. Policymakers also play a role in determining the level of guaranteed interoperability. The report provides recommendations for consumers and policymakers to address interoperability issues and maximize the benefits of DERs.\n\nPolicymakers have been hesitant to standardize interoperability between devices and energy management systems, leading to a proliferation of connectivity standards and smartphone apps. However, the Matter standard, supported by companies like LG, Samsung, and Schneider Electric, shows promise in driving interoperability. Aggregators are emerging as key players in the energy market, enabling consumers to benefit from trading flexibility with the grid. Interoperability challenges include issues with access to and control of inverter-based resources, balancing individual assets on complex sites, and choosing the right internet connection for devices. The Balancing and Settlement Code modification in the UK allows for individual assets to be settled independently, ensuring proper compensation. Manufacturers should implement COP11 standards for asset meters. Compatibility between brands of DER equipment varies, with LG, BYD, and Dyness being more open to compatibility with other major inverter brands. Nissan is currently the only manufacturer offering V2G capabilities. Policymakers should focus on mandating smart inverters, ensuring internet connectivity for inverters, accelerating the implementation of standards like ISO 15118, and providing clarity on communications protocols. The Matter standard and PAS 1878 can also contribute to interoperability. Overall, addressing interoperability challenges is crucial to fully realizing the benefits of DER integration.",

            "summary": "The mid-term adequacy report on the electricity supply-demand balance in France for 2019 shows that the country's security of supply is currently at a level very close to the national reliability standard. This is due to the closure of oil and coal-fired power plants and the decrease in availability of the nuclear power fleet. While the security of supply is still ensured, there is no longer a capacity margin, making it increasingly important to assess the risk level of the power system. The report also highlights the challenges of implementing public energy policy while ensuring compliance with national standards. The report identifies three levers to improve security of supply: controlling demand, optimizing nuclear reactor downtimes, and maintaining or converting the Cordemais power plant. The report also discusses the transition of the power system, with a focus on the development of renewable energies and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the report emphasizes the need to maintain the development trajectories for renewable energies and the importance of the nuclear sector in ensuring security of supply.\n\nThe French Mid-term Adequacy Report 2019 assesses the security of supply in France. It considers various factors such as the commissioning of the Flamanville EPR, the availability of reactors, the closure of coal-fired power plants, and the development of renewable energy sources. The report identifies three levers for ensuring security of supply: controlling demand, optimizing the scheduling of nuclear reactor stoppages, and maintaining the availability of the Cordemais plant. The report also highlights the importance of interconnections with neighboring countries and the potential impact of events such as prolonged cold waves or low wind periods. Overall, the report concludes that the security of supply in France is currently close to the national reliability standard, but certain periods require heightened scrutiny.\n\nThe daily load curve of electricity consumption in France shows the need for generating facilities or demand reduction measures to balance supply and demand over longer periods of time, not just during peak hours. Controlling demand is important for managing the power system and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Various initiatives, such as energy efficiency measures, specific control of power demand, and eco-gestures, can contribute to reducing peak demand. The report also discusses the optimization of nuclear reactor outages and the potential of maintaining or converting the Cordemais power plant to biomass. The growth of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, will lead to a decrease in the share of nuclear power in the electricity generation mix. Gas-fired power plants will play a significant role in the transition period, and the integration of electric vehicles, hydrogen production, and electric heating systems into the power system can help reduce emissions.\n\nThe main results of the electricity supply-demand balance in France for 2019 are summarized below.",

Affordability of energy remains a challenge for emerging and developing economies, particularly in the face of surging energy commodity prices.\n\nAsia Pacific experienced a slowdown in electricity demand growth in 2022 due to the zero-Covid policy in China, but is expected to rebound with an average growth rate of % per year between 2023 and 2025. Coal remains the dominant source of generation in the region, accounting for 57% of electricity production in 2022, but the share of low-carbon sources, including renewables and nuclear, is increasing. China is the largest electricity consumer in the region and is focusing on expanding its renewable energy capacity, with wind and solar PV expected to exceed 1250 GW by 2025. Power market reforms are also underway in China to support the transition to a modern energy system and strengthen carbon pricing mechanisms.\n\nElectricity demand in the Americas region increased by % in 2022, with the United States accounting for the majority of the growth. However, demand is expected to decline by % in 2023 before rebounding in the following years. Renewable generation is driving down emissions in the region, with renewables accounting for 36% of annual generation in 2022. Coal-fired generation is expected to decline, while gas-fired generation will remain stable. Electricity security remains a concern in the United States, with the risk of outages during extreme weather events.\n\nThe life of Diablo Canyon Units will be extended from 2024 and 2025 to 2029 and 2030, respectively. Coal-fired generation in the United States decreased in 2022 after a sharp increase in 2021. Canada is concerned about electricity security, particularly in Alberta and the Maritimes. The expected economic slowdown in Canada in 2023 will lead to a decline in electricity demand. The refurbishment program at the Darlington and Bruce reactors in Canada will result in the temporary shutdown of five out of ten units in the second half of the year. Mexico experienced a quick recovery in energy demand following the pandemic, with electricity demand growing by almost % in 2021. The Mexican government announced a more ambitious GHG reduction target at COP27, shifting from 22% to 35% by 2030. The average CO2 intensity of Mexican power generation increased in 2022 but is expected to decline by 2025. Auctions for renewable energy projects in Mexico were halted in 2022. Brazil's electricity demand increased slightly in 2022 and is set to rise by around % per year. Hydropower generation rebounded in Brazil in 2022 after a severe drought in 2021. The CO2 intensity of power generation in Brazil is expected to continue decreasing. Chile's electricity demand grew in 2022 and is expected to continue growing in the coming years. Colombia's electricity demand fell in 2020 due to the pandemic but recovered in 2021 and 2022. Colombia's renewable capacity has helped limit fossil fuel-powered electricity. Costa Rica's electricity system is almost fully renewable. Europe's electricity consumption rebounded in 2021 but declined in 2022 due to the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The European Union aims to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels and accelerate the clean energy transition. Emergency interventions were implemented in Europe to reduce energy prices and mitigate their impact on consumers and the economy. European electricity-intensive industries decreased their production due to high electricity prices. Germany's electricity demand declined in 2022, but coal-fired power generation increased. France faced a supply imbalance due to nuclear maintenance and low hydropower generation. Italy's electricity consumption fell in 2022, and renewable output is expected to rise. Spain's electricity demand fell in 2022, but power generation increased.\n\nThe Iberian exception, also known as the \"gas cap,\" went into effect in June 2022. It resulted in lower wholesale prices for electricity in Spain but led to increased electricity exports and a boost in gas-fired and coal-fired generation. Solar PV output increased, but there was a drop in March due to haze from the Sahara Desert. Measures have been taken to protect consumers, including reducing access charges for electricity-intensive industries. Electricity consumption in the UK declined in 2022, and there were concerns about winter power outages. The UK became a net electricity exporter for the first time in years. Electricity consumption in Turkey and Ukraine was affected by the war in Ukraine, with significant declines in demand. Electricity consumption in Eurasia and the Middle East grew, with gas-fired generation dominating the mix. In Africa, electricity consumption rebounded in 2021 and is expected to continue growing, with renewables leading the way. South Africa experienced a decline in electricity consumption due to coal availability and project delays.\n\nThe text highlights the unprecedented amount of load shedding in South Africa, with a fourfold increase in unmet demand compared to previous years. Load shedding was implemented for 205 days in 2022, and ongoing issues with new-build coal generation have resulted in more load shedding than anticipated. The outlook for the South African power sector in 2023 is potentially sombre, with new sources of generation needed to address the crisis. The text also mentions measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the power crisis, including the removal of licensing requirements for private energy projects. The report includes data and analysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and acknowledges the contributions of various experts and organizations.\n\nThe figures and tables in this publication are based on data and analysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

It estimates that approximately 1 billion people still live in energy poverty, and investing $130 billion per year in DREs over the next decade could create 25 million new jobs in the power sector and another 500 million jobs in agriculture, healthcare, education, and small and medium-sized enterprises. The report highlights the cost-effectiveness and climate benefits of DREs compared to fossil fuels. It also emphasizes the importance of targeting vulnerable communities and advancing gender inclusion through DRE deployment. The report includes case studies on the potential for solar irrigation in Ethiopia and highlights the success of companies like SunCulture in providing affordable and efficient solar-powered irrigation systems for smallholder farmers.\n\nInvesting in distributed renewable energy (DRE) has the potential to create millions of direct and downstream jobs, particularly in developing countries. In total, around 25 million direct jobs are created, with an additional 500 million new jobs and 700 million improved jobs in downstream sectors. DRE projects create more direct jobs compared to centralized fossil fuel assets, with a job multiplier of 41 times higher. The jobs created are concentrated in sectors such as agriculture, animal production, food processing, essential services, mobility, and heavy industry. These jobs are ideal for low-skilled workers, providing opportunities for those most affected by the Covid-19 crisis. Additionally, investing in DRE can promote gender inclusion and empower women in sectors dominated by them. Specific interventions and investments are needed to support the productive use of electricity in key sectors, such as milk chilling in Nigeria and water pumping in Uganda. Overall, investing in DRE can drive economic recovery, reduce CO2 emissions, and improve the livelihoods of billions of people.\n\nThe text discusses the transformation of agricultural value chains and provides a link to the Rockefeller Foundation's initiative to improve the lives of billions of people.",

However, demand is forecasted to rebound in 2024. China and India are expected to see robust growth in electricity demand, while the USA and the EU are expected to experience declines. Renewable generation is set to overtake coal as the largest source of electricity by 2024, and renewables alone are expected to meet all electricity demand growth in 2023 and 2024. Emissions from power generation are poised to dip slightly through 2024, with increases in emissions in Asia offset by declines in other regions. Wholesale electricity prices remain elevated in many regions, underscoring the increased need for flexibility in the electricity market. Cooling demand is becoming an increasing challenge for power systems, and the availability of hydropower requires greater attention.\n\nGlobal electricity generation from fossil fuels declined in 2020 due to the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. However, there was a rebound in 2021, although it was short-lived. Modest growth in fossil fuel generation is expected in 2022, while declines are predicted in 2023 and 2024. Renewable generation, on the other hand, is expected to continue increasing. Coal-fired generation is increasing in China and India but declining in the US and the EU. Hydropower generation has been affected by droughts in various regions, leading to reduced capacity factors. Global CO2 emissions from power generation are expected to slightly decline through 2024. Wholesale electricity prices remain elevated in many regions, although they have declined from their peak in 2022. Negative prices have become more common in regions with a high share of variable renewable energy.
