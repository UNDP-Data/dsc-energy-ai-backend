    "user_query": "is the promotion of renewable energy a focal point within the energy sector?",
    "answer": "<p>According to the available sources, the promotion of renewable energy is indeed a focal point within the energy sector. One source titled \"Machine learning for a sustainable energy future\" discusses the use of machine learning in achieving a sustainable energy future [1]. Another source titled \"Access to clean cooking services in energy and emission scenarios after COVID-19\" explores the importance of clean cooking services in energy and emission scenarios [2]. Additionally, a source titled \"The justice and policy implications of clean energy transition in Africa\" highlights the justice and policy implications of transitioning to clean energy in Africa [3]. These sources collectively emphasize the significance of promoting renewable energy within the energy sector.</p>\n\n<p>[1]<a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-022-00490-5' data-id='doc-1'>[1]</a> Yao, Z., Lum, Y., Johnston, A., Mejia-Mendoza, L.M., Zhou, X., & Wen, Y.
