    "answer": "  The UN policy in Kazakhstan is outlined in the document titled \"UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework\". However, this document is not directly related to the Energy Strategy and Action Plan for Burundi. In Burundi, only two percent of the population has access to electricity, with most of them residing in the capital city, Bujumbura. The country's energy infrastructure has been severely damaged due to inter-ethnic conflict since 1993. Additionally, limited investment in energy projects, caused by an embargo in 1996 and scarcity of foreign currency, has further hindered progress. The electrical grid in Burundi currently supplies MW, primarily generated by the Rwegura and Mugere hydropower plants. To achieve sustainable use of Burundi's wood-fuel resources, it is crucial to effectively measure wood-fuel production and consumption. Increasing energy efficiency in forestry and wood combustion can help balance demand and supply. Key activities in this regard include raising awareness and implementing improvements. <a href='https://cdn.climatepolicyradar.org/navigator/BDI/2011/energy-strategy-and-action-plan-2011_96451afd5519ade22748864dc1bd389f.pdf' data-id='doc-342'>[1]</a> <br/>\n\n This document highlights Kazakhstan's goal of becoming one of the 30 most developed nations by 2050 and its efforts to modernize institutions, reformulate policies, and address social vulnerabilities.

            "summary": "The study explores the concept of energy justice and just transitions in Scottish energy policy. It analyzes how justice is conceptualized in policy practice through a case study analysis of energy policymaking in Scotland. The study identifies four key thematic categories: affordability and fuel poverty, forms of recognition, energy in relation to political interests and decision-making, and the just transition. The study highlights the importance of addressing justice concerns in energy affairs, particularly in the context of the energy transition. It provides recommendations for academia, Scottish policy, and wider contexts.\n\nScottish energy policy primarily focuses on addressing fuel poverty and affordability issues. There is limited understanding of other dimensions of justice, such as distributional and procedural justice. The Just Transition concept is associated with employment in the fossil fuel industry, but there is a need to expand its scope to include broader justice concerns. Community energy schemes are seen as a way to achieve distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. There is a gap between policymakers' understanding of justice and the use of the Just Transition term in policy documents. Further research is needed to explore misrecognition, monitoring and evaluation, and the recognition of excess energy usage. The energy transition should also consider multi-species justice and the needs of future generations.\n\nThe text provides a list of legislative documents related to various bills and acts in Scotland, including the Housing (Scotland) Bill, Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Bill, Fuel Poverty (Target, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Bill, Heat Networks (Scotland) Bill, Planning (Scotland) Bill, and Transport (Scotland) Bill. It includes links to the online sources where these documents can be accessed.\n\nThe text provides a list of online sources related to the Transport (Scotland) Bill, as well as various Scottish government publications on topics such as energy, fuel poverty, and just transition. It also includes references to academic articles and reports on energy justice and sustainable transitions.\n\nThe article \"Networks: Vision to 2030\" by Santos Ayllón and Jenkins discusses the future of energy networks.

It proposes a comprehensive framework to identify and analyze five types of clean energy inequity and presents the linkages among inequity types, contributing factors, energy justice tenets, and potential policy interventions. The study quantifies and spatially analyzes the inequity potential at the county level in the US, revealing spatial variations in different types of clean energy inequity. The findings highlight the need for spatially tailored policies to address different types of inequity. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers to formulate equitable energy policies and allocate resources for promoting a just energy transition.\n\nThe text discusses the concept of clean energy inequity and presents a framework for understanding and quantifying different types of inequities in the clean energy transition. It identifies five types of clean energy inequity: lack of access to the energy transition, energy burden, energy instability, disruption to carbon-intensive industries, and environmental externalities. The text also highlights the importance of spatially targeted policies to address these inequities and provides examples of how the clean energy inequity potential can be used to analyze energy equity policies. The limitations and future research directions of the framework are also discussed.\n\nThe article \"Energy Policy 67 (2014) 159– Chen et al\" discusses energy policy.",
