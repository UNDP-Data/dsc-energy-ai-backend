    "answer": " <p>The UN Policy in Kazakhstan aims to modernize institutions, reformulate policies, and address social vulnerabilities to achieve sustainable development. Kazakhstan has set a goal to become one of the 30 most developed nations by 2050. Despite achieving high Human Development Index value and reducing poverty levels, inequalities persist across regions and social groups. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Kazakhstan has published an in-depth analysis of the gender balance in the renewable energy sector (RES) in Kazakhstan. The report highlights that the proportion of women in Kazakhstan's energy sector remains lower than that of men, with only 22 percent in the coal industry and 18 percent in the oil and gas sector. However, there is a positive trend in the renewable energy sector, where the percentage of women employed reaches 30 percent, indicating its attractiveness for women compared to traditional energy sectors.\n\nDespite this progress, gender inequalities persist in the energy sector, particularly at decision-making levels. The report reveals that women in the energy sector are mainly concentrated in low-skilled roles, with a high percentage of unskilled women workers, especially in electricity. Moreover, fewer women hold managerial or technical positions. This disparity highlights the need for greater gender equality and empowerment in the energy sector.\n\nIn conclusion, while Kazakhstan has made significant strides in its Human Development Index and poverty reduction, it still faces challenges in achieving gender equality in the energy sector. The UNDP report sheds light on the underrepresentation of women in certain energy sectors and emphasizes the importance of promoting women's participation and leadership in decision-making roles. Efforts should be made to provide equal opportunities and support for women to thrive in the renewable energy sector and break down gender barriers. <a href='https://www.undp.org/kazakhstan/news/undp-report-shows-womens-rising-role-kazakhstan-renewable-energy-sector' data-id='doc-178'>[1]</a> <br/>\n\n</p>\n<p>In the energy sector, Kazakhstan has a relatively low representation of women, particularly in traditional energy sectors such as coal and oil & gas. However, the renewable energy sector shows a higher percentage of women employed compared to traditional sectors.</p>\n<p>The transition to renewable energy is crucial for Kazakhstan's growth pathway. The country has made progress in access to electricity and clean cooking, but there is still room for improvement. Renewable energy capacity per capita is increasing, while air particulate matter (PM2) levels are being monitored to ensure public health safety.</p>\n<p>Kazakhstan's total energy supply consists of both non-renewable and renewable sources. Efforts are being made to increase the share of renewable energy in the total energy supply.</p>\n<p>Overall, the UN Policy in Kazakhstan focuses on promoting sustainable development through diversification of the economy, development of low-carbon alternatives, and addressing social inequalities.</p>",

            "summary": "The study explores the concept of energy justice and just transitions in Scottish energy policy. It analyzes how justice is conceptualized in policy practice through a case study analysis of energy policymaking in Scotland. The study identifies four key thematic categories: affordability and fuel poverty, forms of recognition, energy in relation to political interests and decision-making, and the just transition. The study highlights the importance of addressing justice concerns in energy affairs, particularly in the context of the energy transition. It provides recommendations for academia, Scottish policy, and wider contexts.\n\nScottish energy policy primarily focuses on addressing fuel poverty and affordability issues. There is limited understanding of other dimensions of justice, such as distributional and procedural justice. The Just Transition concept is associated with employment in the fossil fuel industry, but there is a need to expand its scope to include broader justice concerns. Community energy schemes are seen as a way to achieve distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. There is a gap between policymakers' understanding of justice and the use of the Just Transition term in policy documents. Further research is needed to explore misrecognition, monitoring and evaluation, and the recognition of excess energy usage. The energy transition should also consider multi-species justice and the needs of future generations.\n\nThe text provides a list of legislative documents related to various bills and acts in Scotland, including the Housing (Scotland) Bill, Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Bill, Fuel Poverty (Target, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Bill, Heat Networks (Scotland) Bill, Planning (Scotland) Bill, and Transport (Scotland) Bill.

The text also highlights the importance of spatially targeted policies to address these inequities and provides examples of how the clean energy inequity potential can be used to analyze energy equity policies.

            "summary": "This study presents a scenario for a 100% renewable energy system in Europe by the year 2050. The transition to this system is analyzed in a series of steps, including decommissioning nuclear power, implementing heat savings, converting cars to electricity, providing heat in rural and urban areas, converting fuel in heavy-duty vehicles to renewable electrofuel, and replacing natural gas with methane. The results show that a 100% renewable energy system is technically possible without consuming an unsustainable amount of bioenergy. The cost of this scenario is approximately 10-15% higher than business-as-usual, but it will create approximately 10 million additional jobs within the EU.\n\nThe transition to a 100% renewable energy system in the EU can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and energy costs. Savings in energy can be achieved through the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps. The introduction of renewable electrofuels can replace oil in heavy vehicles and industry. Biomass consumption needs to be minimized to ensure sustainability. The overall costs of the energy system do not change significantly in the transition to 100% renewable energy. The renewable energy penetration increases in each step of the transition. However, there are limitations and uncertainties in modeling the future energy system.\n\nThe text discusses the potential pathway to achieving a 100% renewable energy system in Europe by the year 2050. It highlights the need for smart energy systems and the integration of various renewable energy sources. The text also mentions the importance of energy storage technologies and the role of electric vehicles in the transition to a renewable energy system. It emphasizes the need for further research and development in certain areas, such as bioenergy and carbon capture. The text concludes that while there are challenges and uncertainties, achieving a 100% renewable energy system is feasible and would have significant economic and environmental benefits.\n\nThis text is a citation from a research article titled \"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews\" published in 2016 by Connolly et al.
