    "summary": "Access to clean cooking is still a major issue, with over three billion people relying on wood and smoky stoves. Efforts to provide clean cooking access have been lagging behind electricity access. The lack of clean cooking access is costing the world trillions of dollars each year due to health impacts, productivity losses, and environmental degradation. The COVID-19 pandemic has further hindered progress in achieving universal clean cooking access. Existing studies on clean cooking scenarios are limited and do not adequately consider fuel stacking, population heterogeneity, and affordability constraints. Achieving universal clean cooking access by 2030 is unlikely under current scenarios. Additional policies related to energy access and poverty alleviation are needed. Low-income households in sub-Saharan Africa, developing Asia, and Latin America are most at risk of not being able to afford the transition to clean cooking. Transitioning to clean cooking fuels can help reduce future growth in cooking energy demand. Income, urbanization, and energy prices are key factors influencing the transition to cleaner cooking fuels. Access to clean cooking is closely linked to income poverty, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Achieving universal clean cooking access requires immediate acceleration in efforts to make clean cooking accessible and affordable to all.\n\nThe text discusses the need for greater prioritization and coordinated policies to provide access to clean cooking globally, particularly in the most disadvantaged regions and populations. It highlights the importance of better targeting subsidies, directing funds to the clean cooking sector, and implementing awareness-raising campaigns. The text also describes the models and estimation methods used to analyze energy and cooking technology choices in different regions of the world. It emphasizes the urgency of addressing the issue of clean cooking and the underinvestment in the sector. The text concludes by suggesting that directing a fraction of COVID-19 recovery funds to eradicating cooking poverty could help bridge the financing gap.\n\nThe article \"Handle Nature Energy\" was published in November 2021 and is found in Volume 1067-1076.",
