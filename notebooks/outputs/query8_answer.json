    "answer": "The United Nations supports Afghanistan's transition and development through various programs and initiatives. One of the key documents outlining the United Nations' support is the Country Programme Document for Afghanistan (2015-2019). This document highlights the rationale, priorities, partnerships, and risk management strategies for the United Nations' involvement in Afghanistan's development.\n\nThe Afghanistan 'Transformation Decade' begins in 2015, and the United Nations, along with the international community, aims to support Afghanistan in achieving self-reliance in political, security, and development processes. The United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, and the United Nations Office for Project Services are actively involved in this process.\n\nAdditionally, renewable energy plays a crucial role in Afghanistan's development, and the United Nations supports the country in harnessing its renewable energy resources. Afghanistan has significant potential for renewable energy generation, including hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. However, only parts of hydroelectric power projects have been implemented so far. The rapid deployment of renewable energy projects in Afghanistan is expected to bring socio-economic benefits, employment opportunities, energy security, and overall growth. The government of Afghanistan aims to be a partner in international climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nTo further support Afghanistan's renewable energy sector, the Asian Development Bank has provided assistance through the project \"TA-8808 AFG: Renewable Energy Development in Afghanistan.\" The development of a Renewable Energy Roadmap for Afghanistan (RER2032) is one of the outcomes of this project. The roadmap emphasizes the engagement of the private sector and financing institutions in the renewable energy sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the United Nations supports Afghanistan's transition and development through the Country Programme Document, which outlines the rationale, priorities, and partnerships for the United Nations' involvement. The United Nations also supports Afghanistan in harnessing its renewable energy resources through various initiatives, including the development of a Renewable Energy Roadmap.",

Integrating energy efficiency practices to reduce losses across entire range of energy value chain starting from mining and extraction, transformation, transmission and distribution and end use sectors must become a priority for Afghanistan for long term sustainability of resources and providing access to clean energy for everyone. Energy efficiency in Afghanistan is regarded as an embryonic subject matter presently for policy makers as well as wider population, resulting in various levels of challenges in bringing about necessary changes in social and institutional landscape to carry out policy reforms related to energy efficiency.
