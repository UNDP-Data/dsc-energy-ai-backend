    "answer": "The Ministry of Environment's support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change manifests in Argentina's environmental policies through various measures. One of the key aspects is the promotion and implementation of renewable energy sources. According to the Energy Profile Argentina report by IRENA, Argentina has seen growth in renewable energy supply from 2015 to 2020, with a renewable share of 9% in 2020. This indicates a commitment to reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources.\n\nAdditionally, the UN Country programme document for Argentina (2021-2025) highlights the importance of sustainable development cooperation. Argentina, being classified as an upper-middle-income country, recognizes the need to address regional heterogeneity in productivity, well-being, and social indicators. This suggests that the Ministry of Environment's support for the Paris Agreement is integrated into Argentina's broader sustainable development goals.\n\nFurthermore, the document emphasizes the significance of monitoring and evaluation in environmental policies. This indicates that the Ministry of Environment is actively assessing the impact of their initiatives and making necessary adjustments to ensure effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.\n\nOverall, the Ministry of Environment's support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is reflected in Argentina's environmental policies through the promotion of renewable energy, sustainable development cooperation, and a focus on monitoring and evaluation. These efforts demonstrate Argentina's commitment to mitigating climate change and transitioning towards a more sustainable future.",
