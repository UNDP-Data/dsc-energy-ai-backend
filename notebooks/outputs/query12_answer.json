    "answer": "Angola is addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a focus on poverty eradication through various initiatives. The country has shown strong political commitment to strengthen democratic governance, justice, human rights, and fight corruption. This commitment is evident in the creation of the first-ever elected local governments in 2020, which is a flagship policy.\n\nIn terms of energy supply, Angola has made progress in renewable energy. The renewable energy supply in 2020 accounted for 63% of the total energy supply, indicating a significant shift towards cleaner and sustainable energy sources. This aligns with SDG 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.\n\nFurthermore, Angola's efforts in poverty eradication are supported by partnerships and program priorities outlined in the UN Country programme document for Angola (2020-2022). The document emphasizes the need for effective governance, justice, and human rights institutions at both national and local levels to address ongoing structural challenges.\n\nOverall, Angola's approach to addressing the SDGs with a focus on poverty eradication involves strengthening democratic governance, promoting human rights, fighting corruption, and transitioning towards renewable energy sources. These efforts are crucial in achieving sustainable development and improving the well-being of the Angolan population.",
