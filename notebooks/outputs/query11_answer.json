    "answer": "UNDP is implementing several strategies to support Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy. These strategies are outlined in the UN Country programme document for Angola (2020-2022). \n\nOne of the key priorities of the programme is to strengthen democratic governance, justice, and human rights, as well as fight corruption.

These partnerships aim to enhance coordination and cooperation in promoting democratic governance and advocating for human rights.\n\nFurthermore, the programme document highlights the significance of monitoring and evaluation. UNDP is implementing robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track the progress of the strategies and ensure their effectiveness. This allows for adjustments and improvements to be made as needed.\n\nOverall, UNDP's strategies to support Angola's Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy focus on strengthening democratic governance, justice, and human rights, as well as promoting anti-corruption efforts. These strategies involve partnerships, monitoring, and evaluation to ensure their successful implementation.",
