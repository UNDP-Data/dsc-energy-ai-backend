…………: Page:  III Programme and risk management:\\nPage:  IV Monitoring and evaluation …………………………………………………………………………: Page:\\nDP/DCP/KAZ/  UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation\\nFramework  Kazakhstan is an upper-middle-income country which, after two decades\\nof growth and steady socioeconomic progress, has reached  critical juncture To\\nmeet its ambitious goal of becoming one of the 30 most developed nations in the\\nworld by 2050, Kazakhstan seeks to further modernize its institutions and\\nreformulate policies to rebuild trust with citizens, address social\\nvulnerabilities, diversify the economy and develop low-carbon alternatives for\\nits growth pathway While Kazakhstan has achieved  very high Human Development\\nIndex value of 8172 and has significantly reduced poverty levels, inequalities\\npersist as  result of unbalanced development across regions and social groups,\\nespecially pronounced in the country’ cities and remote rural areas  The\\ncountry’ economy is driven by exploitation of natural resources and is based\\nmostly on industry and services Agriculture contributed only  per cent of gross\\ndomestic product (GDP) in series of economic shocks in the last decade has\\nrevealed structural vulnerabilities – social, economic and environmental – that\\nthreaten sustainability and inclusive growth Integration within the regional and\\nglobal economies is limited by trade barriers and distance to global markets The\\ndominance of state-owned enterprises further hinders economic diversification\\nand weakens incentives for private investment Foreign direct investment is\\ngrowing, but with periodic slowdowns Plummeting oil prices and the coronavirus\\ndisease (COVID-19) crisis in early 2020 have exposed and deepened these\\nvulnerabilities As  result, the economy is expected to contract by  per cent in\\n20207 and the dual crises could impact the vulnerable even more  The Government\\nhas increasingly emphasized the need for  knowledge-based and low- carbon\\ndevelopment pathway to alleviate the economy’ dependence on extractive and\\ncarbon-intense industries This requires  transformational change, by aligning\\neducation and industry to respond to the needs of the future of work with the\\nappropriate human capital and productive capacities, supported by technology,\\ninnovation, research and development  As Kazakhstan seeks  sustainable recovery\\npathway, clear strategies on low-carbon development and climate change\\nadaptation are not yet in place Its ambitious vision to promote renewable energy\\nis hampered by various barriers related to markets, financing and technical\\ncapacity Meanwhile, climate change is taking its toll on the agricultural\\nsector, water resources, grazing lands and forests More than 50 per cent of the\\ncurrent glacier mass is expected to be lost by 2100, and climate-related\\ndisasters such as mudflows, floods and droughts have increased in frequency and\\nscale,  trend expected to continue in the next decade Climate change is\\nprojected to cause  steep decrease of water resources (up to 22 per cent) by\\n2100, leading to water stress in all of the country’ eight basins Kazakhstan is\\nmajor supplier of wheat, but yields are expected to decrease by between 13 and\\n49 per cent by 2050, with  total annual economic loss in this sector estimated\\nat $700 million  Beyond these socioeconomic and environmental challenges, low\\nlevels of accountability contribute to mistrust between citizens and\\ninstitutions Despite recent improvements, Kazakhstan ranks 113 of 180 countries\\nin the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index The country has\\nundertaken important institutional reforms, but despite          Ibid  Foreign\\ndirect investment dropped in  (as  percentage of GDP)         DP/DCP/KAZ/\\nvisible progress, investments in -government have not yet yielded the desired\\neffects The COVID-19 pandemic gives new impetus to the need for  more\\ncomprehensive public sector transformation, to one that is people-centred,\\nservice-oriented and accessible, especially by the most vulnerable It also calls\\nfor building resilience to disruptions that could be ensured by disaster and\\npandemic preparedness, response and recovery capabilities  Kazakhstan steadily\\nreduced its Gender Inequality Index value from 405 in 2000 to 202 in 2015,\\nbringing it below the regional average10 However, rankings on other indices for\\npolitical representation, labour force participation,11 gender-related biases\\nand wage differences indicate  need to further reduce gender gaps12 and unlock\\nthe potential of women Currently, only 22 per cent of parliamentary seats are\\nheld by women Gender-based violence remains prevalent13 Although Kazakhstan\\nkeeps  steady record and compares well with other countries, the gaps between\\nmale and female labour force participation and wages are not narrowing14  These\\nchallenges are particularly acute for the nation’ most vulnerable population\\ngroups, as revealed during the COVID-19 outbreak The Government categorizes,\\namong others, people with disabilities, large families, youth, women and the\\nelderly as vulnerable This is determined by such factors as geography, climate,\\naccess to services and discrimination Rural citizens face harsh climate\\nconditions, are remote from markets and suffer from declining employment in\\nagriculture These conditions leave youth in remote areas particularly vulnerable\\nto unemployment People in disaster-prone areas, with high risk of flooding,\\nremain particularly vulnerable15  Kazakhstan has begun to chart its sustainable\\ndevelopment path within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the\\n“Kazakhstan 2050” strategy The Government has created  high-level institutional\\nmechanism to oversee the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and\\nhas taken bold steps towards integrating them in national policies and sectoral\\nprogrammes16 However, stronger political will and sustained action are needed to\\neffectively translate strategies into reality on the ground The country’\\nsustainable development agenda has informed the United Nations Sustainable\\nDevelopment Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), which identifies Goals , 10, 13, 16\\nand 17 as focus areas  UNDP has earned  unique position and value as  trusted\\nlong-term partner of the Government in supporting national policymaking,\\ninstitutional capacity development and design and implementation of critical\\nreform efforts, thanks to its convening role among partners, strong global\\ntechnical capabilities and local presence The long and successful UNDP track\\nrecord facilitates governmental buy-in and commitment, promising to make the\\nwork of UNDP more sustainable and less exposed to shifts in political priorities\\nUNDP is recognized by evaluations for its neutrality, discipline in utilization\\nof government funding, effective procurement systems and transparent decision-\\nmaking17 It is acknowledged for its ability to mobilize cross-sectoral national\\nand international expertise, forge strong partnerships within the United Nations\\nand with other development partners, bring new modalities of implementation and\\nleverage financing This country programme document (CPD) reflects several novel\\naspects that point to the unique role of UNDP in the United Nations system These\\naspects will be applied across all six UNSDCF outcomes, especially in the areas\\nwhere UNDP has  clear comparative 10  11  12  13 Ibid 14 Ibid 15 Common Country\\nAnalysis, United Nations, 16 Ibid 17 UNDP Independent Evaluation Office,\\nIndependent country programme evaluation: Kazakhstan,   DP/DCP/KAZ/ advantage,\\nnamely in strengthening effectiveness and accountability of institutions;\\nfacilitating citizens’ engagement in decision-making; supporting resilience-\\nbuilding, green growth and inclusive economic development; and fostering climate\\naction The first novelty is the four-fold approach of UNDP to catalyse impact\\nthrough: () Thought leadership UNDP will apply modern data and analytics, using\\nits rich global innovative tools to interconnect social, economic and\\nenvironmental analysis across multiple Sustainable Development Goals, and apply\\nnew forecasting and visualization instruments to support transformative and\\nevidence-based approaches to solving complex development problems; () Leveraging\\nresources and partnerships through platforms UNDP will bring multiple\\nstakeholders together around targeted national platforms, including by\\nattracting non- traditional stakeholders such as businesses and foundations to\\nseek integrated development solutions These platforms will be linked to regional\\nand global networks to leverage resources from  broad range of partners through\\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation Existing platforms on the civil service\\nand the Sustainable Development Goals will be expanded to include  green finance\\naccelerator, among others, aiming to leverage resources for investment in green\\ntechnology and services through new partnerships with the Government, the\\nprivate sector and international financial institutions (IFIs); () Innovation\\nThe UNDP approach to innovation involves sense-making, solution mapping and\\nexperimentation towards institutionalization and scaled-up impact Using the\\nabove-mentioned platform approach, UNDP will apply innovation to test solutions\\nand support acceleration for transformational change For example, through the\\nnew platform on green finance, UNDP will test new financing solutions to inform\\npolicy and help leverage partnerships and resources for  low-carbon development\\npathway UNDP will apply innovation in other areas, including through\\nfacilitating digitalized platforms for efficient and participatory public\\nservice delivery, enhancing citizen engagement18 and community-based police\\nmodernization; () Connecting policy results to solutions of scale All of the\\nabove would catalyse impact by scaling up and feeding into policy and legal\\nframeworks As  member of the Government’ coordination councils on the green\\neconomy and on the Sustainable Development Goals, UNDP will continue providing\\nhigh-level policy advice connected to scaled-up development actions to reach the\\nmost vulnerable UNDP will support public sector reform, digitalization and\\nlabour market transformation efforts, with special attention to supporting the\\nUnited Nations response to post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery The second novel\\naspect of the country programme is its offer of four integrated solutions: ()\\nhuman capital; () quality services; () green economy; and () integrated local\\ndevelopment These will be applied to remove bottlenecks and introduce policy\\nmeasures with multiplier effects across all programme areas For example, human\\ncapital development is expected to improve skills and productive capacities for\\nknowledge-based economic transformation while allowing the country to address\\nemerging inequalities around access to advanced education and technology\\nImproved quality of services will contribute to building trust between citizens\\nand the State, but also helping address the needs of the vulnerable and\\npreparing institutions to be more resilient to shocks like COVID-sustained focus\\non the green economy is expected to generate new jobs and support economic\\ndiversification, in addition to addressing environmental issues Integrated local\\ndevelopment will improve conditions for local businesses and value chains, while\\ncreating space for inclusive governance, fostering productive citizen engagement\\nand creating opportunities for youth and women 18  -2019   DP/DCP/KAZ/ The third\\nnovel aspect is the strengthened substance of programme interventions through:\\n() better anchoring in the Sustainable Development Goals framework, with\\nemphasis on data and knowledge; () expanded focus on governance with emphasis on\\nlocal governance, the judiciary and police; () redefining climate resilience\\nwith emphasis on climate finance and the private sector; () renewed focus on\\neconomy, entrepreneurship and skills with emphasis on knowledge and future jobs;\\n() strengthened focus on women and youth as development partners; and ()\\ndeepening focus on social policy with emphasis on addressing inequalities Across\\nall areas of work and in support of the UNSDCF, UNDP will promote knowledge\\nexchange networks and cooperation between Kazakhstan and other countries Through\\nregional and interregional cooperation, Kazakhstan can raise its profile,\\nsharing its own experience and learning from best practices Institutionalization\\nof an official development assistance system is imminent UNDP will support the\\nevolution of the regional Astana Civil Service Hub into an innovative platform\\nto accelerate progress in civil service, anti- corruption, gender equality and\\nintegrated local development The Sustainable Development Goals platform will\\nexpand to bring together countries in the region to better anchor policies with\\ndata and exchanges on innovative financing II Programme priorities and\\npartnerships Guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, UNDP will support\\nKazakhstan to realize national priorities enshrined in Kazakhstan 2050, the 2025\\nStrategic Development Plan and other key strategies and plans These priorities\\ninclude searching for  new model of economic growth and increased productivity;\\nboosting the business environment and scaling up new technologies across\\nsectors; improving institutional performance and effectiveness of key state and\\nsectoral programmes and budgets; modernizing law enforcement and judicial\\nsystems; improving the quality of education and health care; and supporting\\nregional economic development, especially in remote areas The work of UNDP will\\ncut across these national priorities, supporting Kazakhstan in sustaining its\\ngrowth trajectory by diversifying the economy, modernizing institutions,\\nreducing inequalities and sustainably managing natural resources The application\\nof the six UNDP signature solutions will be key to helping the country\\naccelerate structural transformations and better prepare for future shocks In\\nparticular, UNDP will assist the country in four main areas described below\\nAddressing social vulnerabilities and inequalities The Government has been\\ndevoting increased attention to social protection and has created new large-\\nscale initiatives to achieve social protection for all, especially the most\\nvulnerable UNDP will support testing and scaling-up of new models of social\\nprotection platforms for better targeting, focusing and strengthening service\\nprovider capacities It will continue supporting digital solutions allowing for\\ntailor-made approach in service delivery at scale to people with disabilities,\\nthe elderly and large families Digitalization of such services will be tested\\nfor emergency situations to ensure uninterrupted delivery to vulnerable groups\\nThe work on vulnerable groups will feed into policy support for developing\\nnational social support systems In the health sector, UNDP will continue to\\nensure more efficient procurement of high-quality medicines, while supporting\\nsystem-wide resilience of health services to prepare for, respond to and recover\\nfrom crises UNDP will have  specific focus on youth Together with other United\\nNations agencies, it will expand the regional initiative on preventing violent\\nextremism conducive to terrorism While enlarging geographical coverage, the work\\nwill reach  wider target age group and experiment models to improve community\\nresilience This work will contribute to the   DP/DCP/KAZ/ employability of\\nvulnerable young women and men and, in collaboration with youth resource\\ncentres, will introduce social and green entrepreneurship activities to raise\\nawareness for sustainable development Rebuilding trust of citizens through more\\neffective and accountable institutions, free of corruption UNDP will support the\\n“Listening State”19 concept aimed at regaining citizens’ trust in institutional\\nreform This will include improving public administration through digitalization,\\ncrises preparedness and resilience Anti-corruption work will include innovative\\npreventive measures ranging from sectoral risk management and introduction of\\nbehavioural insights to better delivery of -services and citizens’ engagement in\\nbudgetary spending and public procurement National-level work will be\\ncomplemented by advancing local self-governance, emphasizing inclusive and\\ngender-sensitive approaches to planning, budgeting and monitoring, for\\nmeaningful citizen participation to better address inequalities and\\ndiscrimination This will include supporting capacities in local authorities\\n(Akimats) to uphold integrity and engage citizens in local development\\nPartnership with the Parliament will be re-energized for advancing the 2030\\nAgenda UNDP will scale up engagement in judiciary and law-enforcement system\\nreforms prioritized by the country’ leadership UNDP joint work on quality of\\njustice with the Supreme Court and the High Judicial Council will expand to new\\nareas including judicial administration UNDP will provide further support to\\npolice modernization and community policing Rule of law will remain  priority\\nand growing area of engagement, focused on enhancing the National Torture\\nPrevention Mechanism It will also include assistance to the Government in the\\nrealization of its commitments related to the universal periodic review,\\nConvention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and\\nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and related processes UNDP will\\nexpand its partnerships on the 2030 Agenda, offering  platform-based approach\\nUNDP will support the Government in mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goal\\ntargets and indicators into national systems of strategic planning and\\ndevelopment financing, working closely with the Government’ Coordination Council\\nIt will help Kazakhstan identify potential additional financing by: () deploying\\nanalytical support through its global policy network; () leveraging development\\nresources from the public and private sectors and international organizations;\\nand () supporting policy reforms to diversify and increase financial resources\\nUNDP will further advocate for  holistic and long-term development finance\\nstrategy UNDP will continue helping Kazakhstan to become  recognized global\\nplayer, providing support for  national development cooperation system and\\nassociated initiatives, such as women’ empowerment and civil service excellence\\nConcerted efforts will be made to raise the international profile of the Astana\\nCivil Service Hub, support South-South cooperation, develop  regional\\nSustainable Development Goal platform and facilitate regional dialogues to share\\nthe experiences of Kazakhstan on the green economy, sustainable energy and other\\nareas Fostering high-productivity, diversified and knowledge-based economic\\ngrowth The Government recognizes the need to develop human capital in pursuit of\\nnew economic growth model and higher productivity Work will focus on\\nestablishing  country platform on  knowledge-based economy, to bridge the gap\\nbetween education and employers’ needs by reskilling and upskilling the labour\\nforce, and to foster research and innovation to meet future demand induced by\\nnew technologies In collaboration with technical-vocational and education\\ninstitutions, businesses and social incubators, UNDP will 19  -2019\\nDP/DCP/KAZ/ strengthen the professional and entrepreneurial skills and\\nemployment-related resilience of young women and men UNDP work on modernizing\\nthe labour force and the economy will be linked to broader efforts to enhance\\nprivate sector development and market competitiveness UNDP will facilitate the\\nintroduction of new technologies and practices to promote value-chain\\nenhancement and integration, with due consideration of interrelated\\nenvironmental, economic and social effects, starting with the agricultural and\\necotourism sectors To foster the enabling environment for local economic\\ndevelopment, UNDP will support the design and implementation of territorial\\ndevelopment programmes for the most deprived areas of Kazakhstan This work will\\nalso introduce tools to mainstream the Sustainable Development Goals in local\\nplans and budgets UNDP will collaborate with agencies including the United\\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Trade Centre\\nto improve value chains with trade relations in view of their potential for the\\npost-COVID-19 economic recovery to support economic diversification through\\nregional economic cooperation This focus area is closely related to the\\nworkstreams on social vulnerabilities, climate and disaster resilience Preparing\\nfor the economic future includes consideration of new vulnerabilities and\\ninequalities potentially generated in the absence of appropriate social policies\\nand with disruptions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic UNDP will work with\\ndiverse partners to support Kazakhstan in pursuing  holistic approach to\\nstrengthen resilience against possible economic shocks and long-term\\ntransformation in the labour market and business Supporting climate and disaster\\nresilience and nature-based, low-carbon growth UNDP will help Kazakhstan honour\\nits Paris Agreement commitments by supporting the expansion of the green economy\\nto tap into new opportunities for jobs and businesses It will partner with other\\nUnited Nations agencies to provide technical expertise to translate strategies\\ninto action, establish  monitoring framework for climate change adaptation and\\nmitigation, and develop plans for transition to green energy, land management,\\nbiodiversity, reforestation, disaster risk reduction and waste management UNDP\\nwork on climate action will centre on developing and scaling up financing\\nmechanisms for clean technologies and low-carbon business development, via\\ngreen finance accelerator This will build on financing mechanisms for energy\\nefficiency and renewable energy already piloted with the Damu Entrepreneurship\\nDevelopment Fund, with  view to expand to other sectors Low-carbon business\\ndevelopment will be promoted through green bonds, renewable energy auctions and\\ncarbon trading, among other innovative mechanisms In continuing its work on\\nbiodiversity, pastoralism and irrigated agriculture, UNDP will introduce and\\nscale up new solutions and more efficient farming techniques, including for\\nsaving and harvesting water Through private sector engagement, these\\ntechnologies are expected to increase agricultural productivity that will\\npartially offset the decreased yields in drought years As natural hazard risks\\nincrease, UNDP will work with the Emergency Situations Committee to develop\\npolicies, capacities and  natural disaster prevention and response system, while\\naiming to generate new jobs UNDP will support gender equality and women’\\nempowerment across all the above- mentioned areas It will provide assistance to\\nstrengthen the gender machinery, advance implementation of key gender-related\\nlegislation, improve national capacities to address gender-differentiated\\nimpacts of climate change and disasters and support women’ participation in\\ndecision-making in Parliament, business and public administration UNDP will seek\\nto raise women’ skills and catalyse opportunities in emerging sectors, including\\ngreen energy and digital services To help prevent sexual and gender-based\\nviolence, UNDP   DP/DCP/KAZ/ will advance policy dialogue and seek legislative\\nreform, linked with efforts in police and justice sector capacity development\\nIII Programme and risk management During the  cycle, the national budget was\\nprimary source of co-financing, covering nearly 30 per cent of the total\\nprogramme budget Government cost sharing was allocated on an annual and project\\nbasis, without  predictable mechanism The majority of funding came from vertical\\ntrust funds and, for regional projects, directly from donors The shrinking donor\\nspace in Kazakhstan requires UNDP to rethink its financing modality To overcome\\nthe unpredictable, complex and tiered process of government cost-sharing\\napproval, UNDP and the Government will aim to sign an agreement on predictable\\nfunding, to be reviewed annually for yearly allocation across strategic focus\\nareas The main decision- making body will be the Strategic Advisory Council,\\ncoordinated by the Ministry of National Economy as national executing agency for\\nthis country programme Economic recession or change in the Government’\\ndevelopment priorities may hamper the country’ ability to allocate resources for\\nUNDP programmes or office presence UNDP will manage this risk by seeking to\\ndiversify its strategic partnerships, targeting new development financing from\\nIFIs, business and the non-governmental sector, and applying innovative\\nprogramming instruments If funding does not materialize in full, programme\\ntargets and interventions will be revised by UNDP and the Government to meet\\nresource requirements and manage related risks UNDP will monitor the risks of\\ncrises such as natural disasters and public health emergencies Should these\\noccur, based on  government request for assistance, operations will be adjusted\\nin line with the UNDP corporate processes The experience of the unfolding\\nsocioeconomic developments related to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates the\\npossibility of nimble and effective responses to emerging development challenges\\nby leveraging resources from IFIs and global instruments This CPD outlines the\\nUNDP contributions to national results and serves as the primary unit of\\naccountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources\\nassigned to the programme at country level Accountabilities of managers at the\\ncountry, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes is\\nprescribed in the organization’ programme and operations policies and procedures\\nand internal control framework The programme will be nationally executed If\\nnecessary, national execution may be replaced by direct execution for part or\\nall of the programme to enable response to force majeure The harmonized approach\\nto cash transfers will be used in  coordinated fashion with other United Nations\\nagencies to manage financial risks Cost definitions and classifications for\\nprogramme and development effectiveness will be charged to the concerned\\nprojects IV Monitoring and evaluation Mainstreaming of Sustainable Development\\nGoal targets and indicators into the national system of strategic planning and\\nthe UNSDCF provides an opportunity to measure the effectiveness

the\\nworld by 2050, Kazakhstan seeks to further modernize its institutions and\\nreformulate policies to rebuild trust with citizens, address social\\nvulnerabilities, diversify the economy and develop low-carbon alternatives for\\nits growth pathway While Kazakhstan has achieved  very high Human Development\\nIndex value of 8172 and has significantly reduced poverty levels, inequalities\\npersist as  result of unbalanced development across regions and social groups,\\nespecially pronounced in the country’ cities and remote rural areas  The\\ncountry’ economy is driven by exploitation of natural resources and is based\\nmostly on industry and services Agriculture contributed only  per cent of gross\\ndomestic product (GDP) in series of economic shocks in the last decade has\\nrevealed structural vulnerabilities – social, economic and environmental – that\\nthreaten sustainability and inclusive growth Integration within the regional and\\nglobal economies is limited by trade barriers and distance to global markets The\\ndominance of state-owned enterprises further hinders economic diversification\\nand weakens incentives for private investment Foreign direct investment is\\ngrowing, but with periodic slowdowns Plummeting oil prices and the coronavirus\\ndisease (COVID-19) crisis in early 2020 have exposed and deepened these\\nvulnerabilities As  result, the economy is expected to contract by  per cent in\\n20207 and the dual crises could impact the vulnerable even more  The Government\\nhas increasingly emphasized the need for  knowledge-based and low- carbon\\ndevelopment pathway to alleviate the economy’ dependence on extractive and\\ncarbon-intense industries This requires  transformational change, by aligning\\neducation and industry to respond to the needs of the future of work with the\\nappropriate human capital and productive capacities, supported by technology,\\ninnovation, research and development  As Kazakhstan seeks  sustainable recovery\\npathway, clear strategies on low-carbon development and climate change\\nadaptation are not yet in place Its ambitious vision to promote renewable energy\\nis hampered by various barriers related to markets, financing and technical\\ncapacity Meanwhile, climate change is taking its toll on the agricultural\\nsector, water resources, grazing lands and forests More than 50 per cent of the\\ncurrent glacier mass is expected to be lost by 2100, and climate-related\\ndisasters such as mudflows, floods and droughts have increased in frequency and\\nscale,  trend expected to continue in the next decade Climate change is\\nprojected to cause  steep decrease of water resources (up to 22 per cent) by\\n2100, leading to water stress in all of the country’ eight basins Kazakhstan is\\nmajor supplier of wheat, but yields are expected to decrease by between 13 and\\n49 per cent by 2050, with  total annual economic loss in this sector estimated\\nat $700 million  Beyond these socioeconomic and environmental challenges, low\\nlevels of accountability contribute to mistrust between citizens and\\ninstitutions Despite recent improvements, Kazakhstan ranks 113 of 180 countries\\nin the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index The country has\\nundertaken important institutional reforms, but despite          Ibid  Foreign\\ndirect investment dropped in  (as  percentage of GDP)         DP/DCP/KAZ/\\nvisible progress, investments in -government have not yet yielded the desired\\neffects The COVID-19 pandemic gives new impetus to the need for  more\\ncomprehensive public sector transformation, to one that is people-centred,\\nservice-oriented and accessible, especially by the most vulnerable It also calls\\nfor building resilience to disruptions that could be ensured by disaster and\\npandemic preparedness, response and recovery capabilities  Kazakhstan steadily\\nreduced its Gender Inequality Index value from 405 in 2000 to 202 in 2015,\\nbringing it below the regional average10 However, rankings on other indices for\\npolitical representation, labour force participation,11 gender-related biases\\nand wage differences indicate  need to further reduce gender gaps12 and unlock\\nthe potential of women Currently, only 22 per cent of parliamentary seats are\\nheld by women Gender-based violence remains prevalent13 Although Kazakhstan\\nkeeps  steady record and compares well with other countries, the gaps between\\nmale and female labour force participation and wages are not narrowing14  These\\nchallenges are particularly acute for the nation’ most vulnerable population\\ngroups, as revealed during the COVID-19 outbreak The Government categorizes,\\namong others, people with disabilities, large families, youth, women and the\\nelderly as vulnerable This is determined by such factors as geography, climate,\\naccess to services and discrimination Rural citizens face harsh climate\\nconditions, are remote from markets and suffer from declining employment in\\nagriculture These conditions leave youth in remote areas particularly vulnerable\\nto unemployment People in disaster-prone areas, with high risk of flooding,\\nremain particularly vulnerable15  Kazakhstan has begun to chart its sustainable\\ndevelopment path within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the\\n“Kazakhstan 2050” strategy The Government has created  high-level institutional\\nmechanism to oversee the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and\\nhas taken bold steps towards integrating them in national policies and sectoral\\nprogrammes16 However, stronger political will and sustained action are needed to\\neffectively translate strategies into reality on the ground The country’\\nsustainable development agenda has informed the United Nations Sustainable\\nDevelopment Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), which identifies Goals , 10, 13, 16\\nand 17 as focus areas  UNDP has earned  unique position and value as  trusted\\nlong-term partner of the Government in supporting national policymaking,\\ninstitutional capacity development and design and implementation of critical\\nreform efforts, thanks to its convening role among partners, strong global\\ntechnical capabilities and local presence The long and successful UNDP track\\nrecord facilitates governmental buy-in and commitment, promising to make the\\nwork of UNDP more sustainable and less exposed to shifts in political priorities\\nUNDP is recognized by evaluations for its neutrality, discipline in utilization\\nof government funding, effective procurement systems and transparent decision-\\nmaking17 It is acknowledged for its ability to mobilize cross-sectoral national\\nand international expertise, forge strong partnerships within the United Nations\\nand with other development partners, bring new modalities of implementation and\\nleverage financing This country programme document (CPD) reflects several novel\\naspects that point to the unique role of UNDP in the United Nations system These\\naspects will be applied across all six UNSDCF outcomes, especially in the areas\\nwhere UNDP has  clear comparative 10  11  12  13 Ibid 14 Ibid 15 Common Country\\nAnalysis, United Nations, 16 Ibid 17 UNDP Independent Evaluation Office,\\nIndependent country programme evaluation: Kazakhstan,   DP/DCP/KAZ/ advantage,\\nnamely in strengthening effectiveness and accountability of institutions;\\nfacilitating citizens’ engagement in decision-making; supporting resilience-\\nbuilding, green growth and inclusive economic development; and fostering climate\\naction The first novelty is the four-fold approach of UNDP to catalyse impact\\nthrough: () Thought leadership UNDP will apply modern data and analytics, using\\nits rich global innovative tools to interconnect social, economic and\\nenvironmental analysis across multiple Sustainable Development Goals, and apply\\nnew forecasting and visualization instruments to support transformative and\\nevidence-based approaches to solving complex development problems; () Leveraging\\nresources and partnerships through platforms UNDP will bring multiple\\nstakeholders together around targeted national platforms, including by\\nattracting non- traditional stakeholders such as businesses and foundations to\\nseek integrated development solutions These platforms will be linked to regional\\nand global networks to leverage resources from  broad range of partners through\\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation Existing platforms on the civil service\\nand the Sustainable Development Goals will be expanded to include  green finance\\naccelerator, among others, aiming to leverage resources for investment in green\\ntechnology and services through new partnerships with the Government, the\\nprivate sector and international financial institutions (IFIs); () Innovation\\nThe UNDP approach to innovation involves sense-making, solution mapping and\\nexperimentation towards institutionalization and scaled-up impact Using the\\nabove-mentioned platform approach, UNDP will apply innovation to test solutions\\nand support acceleration for transformational change For example, through the\\nnew platform on green finance, UNDP will test new financing solutions to inform\\npolicy and help leverage partnerships and resources for  low-carbon development\\npathway UNDP will apply innovation in other areas, including through\\nfacilitating digitalized platforms for efficient and participatory public\\nservice delivery, enhancing citizen engagement18 and community-based police\\nmodernization; () Connecting policy results to solutions of scale All of the\\nabove would catalyse impact by scaling up and feeding into policy and legal\\nframeworks As  member of the Government’ coordination councils on the green\\neconomy and on the Sustainable Development Goals, UNDP will continue providing\\nhigh-level policy advice connected to scaled-up development actions to reach the\\nmost vulnerable UNDP will support public sector reform, digitalization and\\nlabour market transformation efforts, with special attention to supporting the\\nUnited Nations response to post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery The second novel\\naspect of the country programme is its offer of four integrated solutions: ()\\nhuman capital; () quality services; () green economy; and () integrated local\\ndevelopment These will be applied to remove bottlenecks and introduce policy\\nmeasures with multiplier effects across all programme areas For example, human\\ncapital development is expected to improve skills and productive capacities for\\nknowledge-based economic transformation while allowing the country to address\\nemerging inequalities around access to advanced education and technology\\nImproved quality of services will contribute to building trust between citizens\\nand the State, but also helping address the needs of the vulnerable and\\npreparing institutions to be more resilient to shocks like COVID-sustained focus\\non the green economy is expected to generate new jobs and support economic\\ndiversification, in addition to addressing environmental issues Integrated local\\ndevelopment will improve conditions for local businesses and value chains, while\\ncreating space for inclusive governance, fostering productive citizen engagement\\nand creating opportunities for youth and women 18  -2019   DP/DCP/KAZ/ The third\\nnovel aspect is the strengthened substance of programme interventions through:\\n() better anchoring in the Sustainable Development Goals framework, with\\nemphasis on data and knowledge; () expanded focus on governance with emphasis on\\nlocal governance, the judiciary and police; () redefining climate resilience\\nwith emphasis on climate finance and the private sector; () renewed focus on\\neconomy, entrepreneurship and skills with emphasis on knowledge and future jobs;\\n() strengthened focus on women and youth as development partners; and ()\\ndeepening focus on social policy with emphasis on addressing inequalities Across\\nall areas of work and in support of the UNSDCF, UNDP will promote knowledge\\nexchange networks and cooperation between Kazakhstan and other countries Through\\nregional and interregional cooperation, Kazakhstan can raise its profile,\\nsharing its own experience and learning from best practices Institutionalization\\nof an official development assistance system is imminent UNDP will support the\\nevolution of the regional Astana Civil Service Hub into an innovative platform\\nto accelerate progress in civil service, anti- corruption, gender equality and\\nintegrated local development The Sustainable Development Goals platform will\\nexpand to bring together countries in the region to better anchor policies with\\ndata and exchanges on innovative financing II Programme priorities and\\npartnerships Guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, UNDP will support\\nKazakhstan to realize national priorities enshrined in Kazakhstan 2050, the 2025\\nStrategic Development Plan and other key strategies and plans These priorities\\ninclude searching for  new model of economic growth and increased productivity;\\nboosting the business environment and scaling up new technologies across\\nsectors; improving institutional performance and effectiveness of key state and\\nsectoral programmes and budgets; modernizing law enforcement and judicial\\nsystems; improving the quality of education and health care; and supporting\\nregional economic development, especially in remote areas The work of UNDP will\\ncut across these national priorities, supporting Kazakhstan in sustaining its\\ngrowth trajectory by diversifying the economy, modernizing institutions,\\nreducing inequalities and sustainably managing natural resources The application\\nof the six UNDP signature solutions will be key to helping the country\\naccelerate structural transformations and better prepare for future shocks In\\nparticular, UNDP will assist the country in four main areas described below\\nAddressing social vulnerabilities and inequalities The Government has been\\ndevoting increased attention to social protection and has created new large-\\nscale initiatives to achieve social protection for all, especially the most\\nvulnerable UNDP will support testing and scaling-up of new models of social\\nprotection platforms for better targeting, focusing and strengthening service\\nprovider capacities It will continue supporting digital solutions allowing for\\ntailor-made approach in service delivery at scale to people with disabilities,\\nthe elderly and large families Digitalization of such services will be tested\\nfor emergency situations to ensure uninterrupted delivery to vulnerable groups\\nThe work on vulnerable groups will feed into policy support for developing\\nnational social support systems In the health sector, UNDP will continue to\\nensure more efficient procurement of high-quality medicines, while supporting\\nsystem-wide resilience of health services to prepare for, respond to and recover\\nfrom crises UNDP will have  specific focus on youth Together with other United\\nNations agencies, it will expand the regional initiative on preventing violent\\nextremism conducive to terrorism While enlarging geographical coverage, the work\\nwill reach  wider target age group and experiment models to improve community\\nresilience This work will contribute to the   DP/DCP/KAZ/ employability of\\nvulnerable young women and men and, in collaboration with youth resource\\ncentres, will introduce social and green entrepreneurship activities to raise\\nawareness for sustainable development Rebuilding trust of citizens through more\\neffective and accountable institutions, free of corruption UNDP will support the\\n“Listening State”19 concept aimed at regaining citizens’ trust in institutional\\nreform This will include improving public administration through digitalization,\\ncrises preparedness and resilience Anti-corruption work will include innovative\\npreventive measures ranging from sectoral risk management and introduction of\\nbehavioural insights to better delivery of -services and citizens’ engagement in\\nbudgetary spending and public procurement National-level work will be\\ncomplemented by advancing local self-governance, emphasizing inclusive and\\ngender-sensitive approaches to planning, budgeting and monitoring, for\\nmeaningful citizen participation to better address inequalities and\\ndiscrimination This will include supporting capacities in local authorities\\n(Akimats) to uphold integrity and engage citizens in local development\\nPartnership with the Parliament will be re-energized for advancing the 2030\\nAgenda UNDP will scale up engagement in judiciary and law-enforcement system\\nreforms prioritized by the country’ leadership UNDP joint work on quality of\\njustice with the Supreme Court and the High Judicial Council will expand to new\\nareas including judicial administration UNDP will provide further support to\\npolice modernization and community policing Rule of law will remain  priority\\nand growing area of engagement, focused on enhancing the National Torture\\nPrevention Mechanism It will also include assistance to the Government in the\\nrealization of its commitments related to the universal periodic review,\\nConvention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and\\nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and related processes UNDP will\\nexpand its partnerships on the 2030 Agenda, offering  platform-based approach\\nUNDP will support the Government in mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goal\\ntargets and indicators into national systems of strategic planning and\\ndevelopment financing, working closely with the Government’ Coordination Council\\nIt will help Kazakhstan identify potential additional financing by: () deploying\\nanalytical support through its global policy network; () leveraging development\\nresources from the public and private sectors and international organizations;\\nand () supporting policy reforms to diversify and increase financial resources\\nUNDP will further advocate for  holistic and long-term development finance\\nstrategy UNDP will continue helping Kazakhstan to become  recognized global\\nplayer, providing support for  national development cooperation system and\\nassociated initiatives, such as women’ empowerment and civil service excellence\\nConcerted efforts will be made to raise the international profile of the Astana\\nCivil Service Hub, support South-South cooperation, develop  regional\\nSustainable Development Goal platform and facilitate regional dialogues to share\\nthe experiences of Kazakhstan on the green economy, sustainable energy and other\\nareas Fostering high-productivity, diversified and knowledge-based economic\\ngrowth The Government recognizes the need to develop human capital in pursuit of\\nnew economic growth model and higher productivity Work will focus on\\nestablishing  country platform on  knowledge-based economy, to bridge the gap\\nbetween education and employers’ needs by reskilling and upskilling the labour\\nforce, and to foster research and innovation to meet future demand induced by\\nnew technologies In collaboration with technical-vocational and education\\ninstitutions, businesses and social incubators, UNDP will 19  -2019\\nDP/DCP/KAZ/ strengthen the professional and entrepreneurial skills and\\nemployment-related resilience of young women and men UNDP work on modernizing\\nthe labour force and the economy will be linked to broader efforts to enhance\\nprivate sector development and market competitiveness UNDP will facilitate the\\nintroduction of new technologies and practices to promote value-chain\\nenhancement and integration, with due consideration of interrelated\\nenvironmental, economic and social effects, starting with the agricultural and\\necotourism sectors To foster the enabling environment for local economic\\ndevelopment, UNDP will support the design and implementation of territorial\\ndevelopment programmes for the most deprived areas of Kazakhstan This work will\\nalso introduce tools to mainstream the Sustainable Development Goals in local\\nplans and budgets UNDP will collaborate with agencies including the United\\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Trade Centre\\nto improve value chains with trade relations in view of their potential for the\\npost-COVID-19 economic recovery to support economic diversification through\\nregional economic cooperation This focus area is closely related to the\\nworkstreams on social vulnerabilities, climate and disaster resilience Preparing\\nfor the economic future includes consideration of new vulnerabilities and\\ninequalities potentially generated in the absence of appropriate social policies\\nand with disruptions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic UNDP will work with\\ndiverse partners to support Kazakhstan in pursuing  holistic approach to\\nstrengthen resilience against possible economic shocks and long-term\\ntransformation in the labour market and business Supporting climate and disaster\\nresilience and nature-based, low-carbon growth UNDP will help Kazakhstan honour\\nits Paris Agreement commitments by supporting the expansion of the green economy\\nto tap into new opportunities for jobs and businesses It will partner with other\\nUnited Nations agencies to provide technical expertise to translate strategies\\ninto action, establish  monitoring framework for climate change adaptation and\\nmitigation, and develop plans for transition to green energy, land management,\\nbiodiversity, reforestation, disaster risk reduction and waste management UNDP\\nwork on climate action will centre on developing and scaling up financing\\nmechanisms for clean technologies and low-carbon business development, via\\ngreen finance accelerator This will build on financing mechanisms for energy\\nefficiency and renewable energy already piloted with the Damu Entrepreneurship\\nDevelopment Fund, with  view to expand to other sectors Low-carbon business\\ndevelopment will be promoted through green bonds, renewable energy auctions and\\ncarbon trading, among other innovative mechanisms In continuing its work on\\nbiodiversity, pastoralism and irrigated agriculture, UNDP will introduce and\\nscale up new solutions and more efficient farming techniques, including for\\nsaving and harvesting water Through private sector engagement, these\\ntechnologies are expected to increase agricultural productivity that will\\npartially offset the decreased yields in drought years As natural hazard risks\\nincrease, UNDP will work with the Emergency Situations Committee to develop\\npolicies, capacities and  natural disaster prevention and response system, while\\naiming to generate new jobs UNDP will support gender equality and women’\\nempowerment across all the above- mentioned areas It will provide assistance to\\nstrengthen the gender machinery, advance implementation of key gender-related\\nlegislation, improve national capacities to address gender-differentiated\\nimpacts of climate change and disasters and support women’ participation in\\ndecision-making in Parliament, business and public administration UNDP will seek\\nto raise women’ skills and catalyse opportunities in emerging sectors, including\\ngreen energy and digital services To help prevent sexual and gender-based\\nviolence, UNDP   DP/DCP/KAZ/ will advance policy dialogue and seek legislative\\nreform, linked with efforts in police and justice sector capacity development\\nIII Programme and risk management During the  cycle, the national budget was\\nprimary source of co-financing, covering nearly 30 per cent of the total\\nprogramme budget Government cost sharing was allocated on an annual and project\\nbasis, without  predictable mechanism The majority of funding came from vertical\\ntrust funds and, for regional projects, directly from donors The shrinking donor\\nspace in Kazakhstan requires UNDP to rethink its financing modality To overcome\\nthe unpredictable, complex and tiered process of government cost-sharing\\napproval, UNDP and the Government will aim to sign an agreement on predictable\\nfunding, to be reviewed annually for yearly allocation across strategic focus\\nareas The main decision- making body will be the Strategic Advisory Council,\\ncoordinated by the Ministry of National Economy as national executing agency for\\nthis country programme Economic recession or change in the Government’\\ndevelopment priorities may hamper the country’ ability to allocate resources for\\nUNDP programmes or office presence UNDP will manage this risk by seeking to\\ndiversify its strategic partnerships, targeting new development financing from\\nIFIs, business and the non-governmental sector, and applying innovative\\nprogramming instruments If funding does not materialize in full, programme\\ntargets and interventions will be revised by UNDP and the Government to meet\\nresource requirements and manage related risks UNDP will monitor the risks of\\ncrises such as natural disasters and public health emergencies Should these\\noccur, based on  government request for assistance, operations will be adjusted\\nin line with the UNDP corporate processes The experience of the unfolding\\nsocioeconomic developments related to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates the\\npossibility of nimble and effective responses to emerging development challenges\\nby leveraging resources from IFIs and global instruments This CPD outlines the\\nUNDP contributions to national results and serves as the primary unit of\\naccountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources\\nassigned to the programme at country level Accountabilities of managers at the\\ncountry, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes is\\nprescribed in the organization’ programme and operations policies and procedures\\nand internal control framework The programme will be nationally executed If\\nnecessary, national execution may be replaced by direct execution for part or\\nall of the programme to enable response to force majeure The harmonized approach\\nto cash transfers will be used in  coordinated fashion with other United Nations\\nagencies to manage financial risks Cost definitions and classifications for\\nprogramme and development effectiveness will be charged to the concerned\\nprojects IV Monitoring and evaluation Mainstreaming of Sustainable Development\\nGoal targets and indicators into the national system of strategic planning and\\nthe UNSDCF provides an opportunity to measure the effectiveness of joint work\\nUNDP will utilize national data systems to assess development progress and help\\nthe country strengthen national data quality and availability Through joint work\\nwith the Accounts Committee, National Committee on Statistics, Economic Research\\nInstitute and other relevant institutions and civil society organizations, UNDP\\nwill invest in national monitoring and evaluation (&) capacities to better\\ncapture results of national programmes and lessons learned The new and\\ninnovative methodologies used by UNDP such as sense-making, rapid integrated\\nassessment and development finance assessment, as well as big data collection\\nand visualization, will provide instruments and comparative advantage for UNDP\\nto be  partner of choice for the national monitoring system upgrade\\nDP/DCP/KAZ/ Internally, UNDP will increase its & capacities Together with its\\nimplementing partners, UNDP will conduct joint reviews of annual progress of\\nprogramme implementation & quality control will be ensured through independent\\naudits and evaluations, to be conducted in line with UNDP policies and\\nprocedures UNDP and partners will implement an evaluation plan, applying new\\ntechniques to ensure cost-effective compilation of appropriate evidence  robust\\nmonitoring plan will be established utilizing the enhanced analytics and\\nupgraded staff capacities

 IV Monitoring and evaluation …………………………………………………………………………: Page:\\nDP/DCP/KAZ/  UNDP within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation\\nFramework  Kazakhstan is an upper-middle-income country which, after two decades\\nof growth and steady socioeconomic progress, has reached  critical juncture To\\nmeet its ambitious goal of becoming one of the 30 most developed nations in the\\nworld by 2050, Kazakhstan seeks to further modernize its institutions and\\nreformulate policies to rebuild trust with citizens, address social\\nvulnerabilities, diversify the economy and develop low-carbon alternatives for\\nits growth pathway While Kazakhstan has achieved  very high Human Development\\nIndex value of 8172 and has significantly reduced poverty levels, inequalities\\npersist as  result of unbalanced development across regions and social groups,\\nespecially pronounced in the country’ cities and remote rural areas  The\\ncountry’ economy is driven by exploitation of natural resources and is based\\nmostly on industry and services Agriculture contributed only  per cent of gross\\ndomestic product (GDP) in series of economic shocks in the last decade has\\nrevealed structural vulnerabilities – social, economic and environmental – that\\nthreaten sustainability and inclusive growth Integration within the regional and\\nglobal economies is limited by trade barriers and distance to global markets The\\ndominance of state-owned enterprises further hinders economic diversification\\nand weakens incentives for private investment Foreign direct investment is\\ngrowing, but with periodic slowdowns Plummeting oil prices and the coronavirus\\ndisease (COVID-19) crisis in early 2020 have exposed and deepened these\\nvulnerabilities As  result, the economy is expected to contract by  per cent in\\n20207 and the dual crises could impact the vulnerable even more  The Government\\nhas increasingly emphasized the need for  knowledge-based and low- carbon\\ndevelopment pathway to alleviate the economy’ dependence on extractive and\\ncarbon-intense industries This requires  transformational change, by aligning\\neducation and industry to respond to the needs of the future of work with the\\nappropriate human capital and productive capacities, supported by technology,\\ninnovation, research and development  As Kazakhstan seeks  sustainable recovery\\npathway, clear strategies on low-carbon development and climate change\\nadaptation are not yet in place Its ambitious vision to promote renewable energy\\nis hampered by various barriers related to markets, financing and technical\\ncapacity Meanwhile, climate change is taking its toll on the agricultural\\nsector, water resources, grazing lands and forests More than 50 per cent of the\\ncurrent glacier mass is expected to be lost by 2100, and climate-related\\ndisasters such as mudflows, floods and droughts have increased in frequency and\\nscale,  trend expected to continue in the next decade Climate change is\\nprojected to cause  steep decrease of water resources (up to 22 per cent) by\\n2100, leading to water stress in all of the country’ eight basins Kazakhstan is\\nmajor supplier of wheat, but yields are expected to decrease by between 13 and\\n49 per cent by 2050, with  total annual economic loss in this sector estimated\\nat $700 million  Beyond these socioeconomic and environmental challenges, low\\nlevels of accountability contribute to mistrust between citizens and\\ninstitutions Despite recent improvements, Kazakhstan ranks 113 of 180 countries\\nin the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index The country has\\nundertaken important institutional reforms, but despite          Ibid  Foreign\\ndirect investment dropped in  (as  percentage of GDP)         DP/DCP/KAZ/\\nvisible progress, investments in -government have not yet yielded the desired\\neffects The COVID-19 pandemic gives new impetus to the need for  more\\ncomprehensive public sector transformation, to one that is people-centred,\\nservice-oriented and accessible, especially by the most vulnerable It also calls\\nfor building resilience to disruptions that could be ensured by disaster and\\npandemic preparedness, response and recovery capabilities  Kazakhstan steadily\\nreduced its Gender Inequality Index value from 405 in 2000 to 202 in 2015,\\nbringing it below the regional average10 However, rankings on other indices for\\npolitical representation, labour force participation,11 gender-related biases\\nand wage differences indicate  need to further reduce gender gaps12 and unlock\\nthe potential of women Currently, only 22 per cent of parliamentary seats are\\nheld by women Gender-based violence remains prevalent13 Although Kazakhstan\\nkeeps  steady record and compares well with other countries, the gaps between\\nmale and female labour force participation and wages are not narrowing14  These\\nchallenges are particularly acute for the nation’ most vulnerable population\\ngroups, as revealed during the COVID-19 outbreak The Government categorizes,\\namong others, people with disabilities, large families, youth, women and the\\nelderly as vulnerable This is determined by such factors as geography, climate,\\naccess to services and discrimination Rural citizens face harsh climate\\nconditions, are remote from markets and suffer from declining employment in\\nagriculture These conditions leave youth in remote areas particularly vulnerable\\nto unemployment People in disaster-prone areas, with high risk of flooding,\\nremain particularly vulnerable15  Kazakhstan has begun to chart its sustainable\\ndevelopment path within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the\\n“Kazakhstan 2050” strategy The Government has created  high-level institutional\\nmechanism to oversee the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and\\nhas taken bold steps towards integrating them in national policies and sectoral\\nprogrammes16 However, stronger political will and sustained action are needed to\\neffectively translate strategies into reality on the ground The country’\\nsustainable development agenda has informed the United Nations Sustainable\\nDevelopment Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), which identifies Goals , 10, 13, 16\\nand 17 as focus areas  UNDP has earned  unique position and value as  trusted\\nlong-term partner of the Government in supporting national policymaking,\\ninstitutional capacity development and design and implementation of critical\\nreform efforts, thanks to its convening role among partners, strong global\\ntechnical capabilities and local presence The long and successful UNDP track\\nrecord facilitates governmental buy-in and commitment, promising to make the\\nwork of UNDP more sustainable and less exposed to shifts in political priorities\\nUNDP is recognized by evaluations for its neutrality, discipline in utilization\\nof government funding, effective procurement systems and transparent decision-\\nmaking17 It is acknowledged for its ability to mobilize cross-sectoral national\\nand international expertise, forge strong partnerships within the United Nations\\nand with other development partners, bring new modalities of implementation and\\nleverage financing This country programme document (CPD) reflects several novel\\naspects that point to the unique role of UNDP in the United Nations system These\\naspects will be applied across all six UNSDCF outcomes, especially in the areas\\nwhere UNDP has  clear comparative 10  11  12  13 Ibid 14 Ibid 15 Common Country\\nAnalysis, United Nations, 16 Ibid 17 UNDP Independent Evaluation Office,\\nIndependent country programme evaluation: Kazakhstan,   DP/DCP/KAZ/ advantage,\\nnamely in strengthening effectiveness and accountability of institutions;\\nfacilitating citizens’ engagement in decision-making; supporting resilience-\\nbuilding, green growth and inclusive economic development; and fostering climate\\naction The first novelty is the four-fold approach of UNDP to catalyse impact\\nthrough: () Thought leadership UNDP will apply modern data and analytics, using\\nits rich global innovative tools to interconnect social, economic and\\nenvironmental analysis across multiple Sustainable Development Goals, and apply\\nnew forecasting and visualization instruments to support transformative and\\nevidence-based approaches to solving complex development problems; () Leveraging\\nresources and partnerships through platforms UNDP will bring multiple\\nstakeholders together around targeted national platforms, including by\\nattracting non- traditional stakeholders such as businesses and foundations to\\nseek integrated development solutions These platforms will be linked to regional\\nand global networks to leverage resources from  broad range of partners through\\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation Existing platforms on the civil service\\nand the Sustainable Development Goals will be expanded to include  green finance\\naccelerator, among others, aiming to leverage resources for investment in green\\ntechnology and services through new partnerships with the Government, the\\nprivate sector and international financial institutions (IFIs); () Innovation\\nThe UNDP approach to innovation involves sense-making, solution mapping and\\nexperimentation towards institutionalization and scaled-up impact Using the\\nabove-mentioned platform approach, UNDP will apply innovation to test solutions\\nand support acceleration for transformational change For example, through the\\nnew platform on green finance, UNDP will test new financing solutions to inform\\npolicy and help leverage partnerships and resources for  low-carbon development\\npathway UNDP will apply innovation in other areas, including through\\nfacilitating digitalized platforms for efficient and participatory public\\nservice delivery, enhancing citizen engagement18 and community-based police\\nmodernization; () Connecting policy results to solutions of scale All of the\\nabove would catalyse impact by scaling up and feeding into policy and legal\\nframeworks As  member of the Government’ coordination councils on the green\\neconomy and on the Sustainable Development Goals, UNDP will continue providing\\nhigh-level policy advice connected to scaled-up development actions to reach the\\nmost vulnerable UNDP will support public sector reform, digitalization and\\nlabour market transformation efforts, with special attention to supporting the\\nUnited Nations response to post-COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery The second novel\\naspect of the country programme is its offer of four integrated solutions: ()\\nhuman capital; () quality services; () green economy; and () integrated local\\ndevelopment These will be applied to remove bottlenecks and introduce policy\\nmeasures with multiplier effects across all programme areas For example, human\\ncapital development is expected to improve skills and productive capacities for\\nknowledge-based economic transformation while allowing the country to address\\nemerging inequalities around access to advanced education and technology\\nImproved quality of services will contribute to building trust between citizens\\nand the State, but also helping address the needs of the vulnerable and\\npreparing institutions to be more resilient to shocks like COVID-sustained focus\\non the green economy is expected to generate new jobs and support economic\\ndiversification, in addition to addressing environmental issues Integrated local\\ndevelopment will improve conditions for local businesses and value chains, while\\ncreating space for inclusive governance, fostering productive citizen engagement\\nand creating opportunities for youth and women 18  -2019   DP/DCP/KAZ/ The third\\nnovel aspect is the strengthened substance of programme interventions through:\\n() better anchoring in the Sustainable Development Goals framework, with\\nemphasis on data and knowledge; () expanded focus on governance with emphasis on\\nlocal governance, the judiciary and police; () redefining climate resilience\\nwith emphasis on climate finance and the private sector; () renewed focus on\\neconomy, entrepreneurship and skills with emphasis on knowledge and future jobs;\\n() strengthened focus on women and youth as development partners; and ()\\ndeepening focus on social policy with emphasis on addressing inequalities Across\\nall areas of work and in support of the UNSDCF, UNDP will promote knowledge\\nexchange networks and cooperation between Kazakhstan and other countries Through\\nregional and interregional cooperation, Kazakhstan can raise its profile,\\nsharing its own experience and learning from best practices Institutionalization\\nof an official development assistance system is imminent UNDP will support the\\nevolution of the regional Astana Civil Service Hub into an innovative platform\\nto accelerate progress in civil service, anti- corruption, gender equality and\\nintegrated local development The Sustainable Development Goals platform will\\nexpand to bring together countries in the region to better anchor policies with\\ndata and exchanges on innovative financing II Programme priorities and\\npartnerships Guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, UNDP will support\\nKazakhstan to realize national priorities enshrined in Kazakhstan 2050, the 2025\\nStrategic Development Plan and other key strategies and plans These priorities\\ninclude searching for  new model of economic growth and increased productivity;\\nboosting the business environment and scaling up new technologies across\\nsectors; improving institutional performance and effectiveness of key state and\\nsectoral programmes and budgets; modernizing law enforcement and judicial\\nsystems; improving the quality of education and health care; and supporting\\nregional economic development, especially in remote areas The work of UNDP will\\ncut across these national priorities, supporting Kazakhstan in sustaining its\\ngrowth trajectory by diversifying the economy, modernizing institutions,\\nreducing inequalities and sustainably managing natural resources The application\\nof the six UNDP signature solutions will be key to helping the country\\naccelerate structural transformations and better prepare for future shocks In\\nparticular, UNDP will assist the country in four main areas described below\\nAddressing social vulnerabilities and inequalities The Government has been\\ndevoting increased attention to social protection and has created new large-\\nscale initiatives to achieve social protection for all, especially the most\\nvulnerable UNDP will support testing and scaling-up of new models of social\\nprotection platforms for better targeting, focusing and strengthening service\\nprovider capacities It will continue supporting digital solutions allowing for\\ntailor-made approach in service delivery at scale to people with disabilities,\\nthe elderly and large families Digitalization of such services will be tested\\nfor emergency situations to ensure uninterrupted delivery to vulnerable groups\\nThe work on vulnerable groups will feed into policy support for developing\\nnational social support systems In the health sector, UNDP will continue to\\nensure more efficient procurement of high-quality medicines, while supporting\\nsystem-wide resilience of health services to prepare for, respond to and recover\\nfrom crises UNDP will have  specific focus on youth Together with other United\\nNations agencies, it will expand the regional initiative on preventing violent\\nextremism conducive to terrorism While enlarging geographical coverage, the work\\nwill reach  wider target age group and experiment models to improve community\\nresilience This work will contribute to the   DP/DCP/KAZ/ employability of\\nvulnerable young women and men and, in collaboration with youth resource\\ncentres, will introduce social and green entrepreneurship activities to raise\\nawareness for sustainable development Rebuilding trust of citizens through more\\neffective and accountable institutions, free of corruption UNDP will support the\\n“Listening State”19 concept aimed at regaining citizens’ trust in institutional\\nreform This will include improving public administration through digitalization,\\ncrises preparedness and resilience Anti-corruption work will include innovative\\npreventive measures ranging from sectoral risk management and introduction of\\nbehavioural insights to better delivery of -services and citizens’ engagement in\\nbudgetary spending and public procurement National-level work will be\\ncomplemented by advancing local self-governance, emphasizing inclusive and\\ngender-sensitive approaches to planning, budgeting and monitoring, for\\nmeaningful citizen participation to better address inequalities and\\ndiscrimination This will include supporting capacities in local authorities\\n(Akimats) to uphold integrity and engage citizens in local development\\nPartnership with the Parliament will be re-energized for advancing the 2030\\nAgenda UNDP will scale up engagement in judiciary and law-enforcement system\\nreforms prioritized by the country’ leadership UNDP joint work on quality of\\njustice with the Supreme Court and the High Judicial Council will expand to new\\nareas including judicial administration UNDP will provide further support to\\npolice modernization and community policing Rule of law will remain  priority\\nand growing area of engagement, focused on enhancing the National Torture\\nPrevention Mechanism It will also include assistance to the Government in the\\nrealization of its commitments related to the universal periodic review,\\nConvention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and\\nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and related processes UNDP will\\nexpand its partnerships on the 2030 Agenda, offering  platform-based approach\\nUNDP will support the Government in mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goal\\ntargets and indicators into national systems of strategic planning and\\ndevelopment financing, working closely with the Government’ Coordination Council\\nIt will help Kazakhstan identify potential additional financing by: () deploying\\nanalytical support through its global policy network; () leveraging development\\nresources from the public and private sectors and international organizations;\\nand () supporting policy reforms to diversify and increase financial resources\\nUNDP will further advocate for  holistic and long-term development finance\\nstrategy UNDP will continue helping Kazakhstan to become  recognized global\\nplayer, providing support for  national development cooperation system and\\nassociated initiatives, such as women’ empowerment and civil service excellence\\nConcerted efforts will be made to raise the international profile of the Astana\\nCivil Service Hub, support South-South cooperation, develop  regional\\nSustainable Development Goal platform and facilitate regional dialogues to share\\nthe experiences of Kazakhstan on the green economy, sustainable energy and other\\nareas Fostering high-productivity, diversified and knowledge-based economic\\ngrowth The Government recognizes the need to develop human capital in pursuit of\\nnew economic growth model and higher productivity Work will focus on\\nestablishing  country platform on  knowledge-based economy, to bridge the gap\\nbetween education and employers’ needs by reskilling and upskilling the labour\\nforce, and to foster research and innovation to meet future demand induced by\\nnew technologies In collaboration with technical-vocational and education\\ninstitutions, businesses and social incubators, UNDP will 19  -2019\\nDP/DCP/KAZ/ strengthen the professional and entrepreneurial skills and\\nemployment-related resilience of young women and men UNDP work on modernizing\\nthe labour force and the economy will be linked to broader efforts to enhance\\nprivate sector development and market competitiveness UNDP will facilitate the\\nintroduction of new technologies and practices to promote value-chain\\nenhancement and integration, with due consideration of interrelated\\nenvironmental, economic and social effects, starting with the agricultural and\\necotourism sectors To foster the enabling environment for local economic\\ndevelopment, UNDP will support the design and implementation of territorial\\ndevelopment programmes for the most deprived areas of Kazakhstan This work will\\nalso introduce tools to mainstream the Sustainable Development Goals in local\\nplans and budgets UNDP will collaborate with agencies including the United\\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Trade Centre\\nto improve value chains with trade relations in view of their potential for the\\npost-COVID-19 economic recovery to support economic diversification through\\nregional economic cooperation This focus area is closely related to the\\nworkstreams on social vulnerabilities, climate and disaster resilience Preparing\\nfor the economic future includes consideration of new vulnerabilities and\\ninequalities potentially generated in the absence of appropriate social policies\\nand with disruptions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic UNDP will work with\\ndiverse partners to support Kazakhstan in pursuing  holistic approach to\\nstrengthen resilience against possible economic shocks and long-term\\ntransformation in the labour market and business Supporting climate and disaster\\nresilience and nature-based, low-carbon growth UNDP will help Kazakhstan honour\\nits Paris Agreement commitments by supporting the expansion of the green economy\\nto tap into new opportunities for jobs and businesses It will partner with other\\nUnited Nations agencies to provide technical expertise to translate strategies\\ninto action, establish  monitoring framework for climate change adaptation and\\nmitigation, and develop plans for transition to green energy, land management,\\nbiodiversity, reforestation, disaster risk reduction and waste management UNDP\\nwork on climate action will centre on developing and scaling up financing\\nmechanisms for clean technologies and low-carbon business development, via\\ngreen finance accelerator This will build on financing mechanisms for energy\\nefficiency and renewable energy already piloted with the Damu Entrepreneurship\\nDevelopment Fund, with  view to expand to other sectors Low-carbon business\\ndevelopment will be promoted through green bonds, renewable energy auctions and\\ncarbon trading, among other innovative mechanisms In continuing its work on\\nbiodiversity, pastoralism and irrigated agriculture, UNDP will introduce and\\nscale up new solutions and more efficient farming techniques, including for\\nsaving and harvesting water Through private sector engagement, these\\ntechnologies are expected to increase agricultural productivity that will\\npartially offset the decreased yields in drought years As natural hazard risks\\nincrease, UNDP will work with the Emergency Situations Committee to develop\\npolicies, capacities and  natural disaster prevention and response system, while\\naiming to generate new jobs UNDP will support gender equality and women’\\nempowerment across all the above- mentioned areas It will provide assistance to\\nstrengthen the gender machinery, advance implementation of key gender-related\\nlegislation, improve national capacities to address gender-differentiated\\nimpacts of climate change and disasters and support women’ participation in\\ndecision-making in Parliament, business and public administration UNDP will seek\\nto raise women’ skills and catalyse opportunities in emerging sectors, including\\ngreen energy and digital services To help prevent sexual and gender-based\\nviolence, UNDP   DP/DCP/KAZ/ will advance policy dialogue and seek legislative\\nreform, linked with efforts in police and justice sector capacity development\\nIII Programme and risk management During the  cycle, the national budget was\\nprimary source of co-financing, covering nearly 30 per cent of the total\\nprogramme budget Government cost sharing was allocated on an annual and project\\nbasis, without  predictable mechanism The majority of funding came from vertical\\ntrust funds and, for regional projects, directly from donors The shrinking donor\\nspace in Kazakhstan requires UNDP to rethink its financing modality To overcome\\nthe unpredictable, complex and tiered process of government cost-sharing\\napproval, UNDP and the Government will aim to sign an agreement on predictable\\nfunding, to be reviewed annually for yearly allocation across strategic focus\\nareas The main decision- making body will be the Strategic Advisory Council,\\ncoordinated by the Ministry of National Economy as national executing agency for\\nthis country programme Economic recession or change in the Government’\\ndevelopment priorities may hamper the country’ ability to allocate resources for\\nUNDP programmes or office presence UNDP will manage this risk by seeking to\\ndiversify its strategic partnerships, targeting new development financing from\\nIFIs, business and the non-governmental sector, and applying innovative\\nprogramming instruments If funding does not materialize in full, programme\\ntargets and interventions will be revised by UNDP and the Government to meet\\nresource requirements and manage related risks UNDP will monitor the risks of\\ncrises such as natural disasters and public health emergencies Should these\\noccur, based on  government request for assistance, operations will be adjusted\\nin line with the UNDP corporate processes The experience of the unfolding\\nsocioeconomic developments related to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates the\\npossibility of nimble and effective responses to emerging development challenges\\nby leveraging resources from IFIs and global instruments This CPD outlines the\\nUNDP contributions to national results and serves as the primary unit of\\naccountability to the Executive Board for results alignment and resources\\nassigned to the programme at country level Accountabilities of managers at the\\ncountry, regional and headquarter levels with respect to country programmes is\\nprescribed in the organization’ programme and operations policies and procedures\\nand internal control framework The programme will be nationally executed If\\nnecessary, national execution may be replaced by direct execution for part or\\nall of the programme to enable response to force majeure The harmonized approach\\nto cash transfers will be used in  coordinated fashion with other United Nations\\nagencies to manage financial risks Cost definitions and classifications for\\nprogramme and development effectiveness will be charged to the concerned\\nprojects IV Monitoring and evaluation Mainstreaming of Sustainable Development\\nGoal targets and indicators into the national system of strategic planning and\\nthe UNSDCF provides an opportunity to measure the effectiveness of joint work\\nUNDP will utilize national data systems to assess development progress and help\\nthe country strengthen national data quality and availability Through joint work\\nwith the Accounts Committee, National Committee on Statistics, Economic Research\\nInstitute and other relevant institutions and civil society organizations, UNDP\\nwill invest in national monitoring and evaluation (&) capacities to better\\ncapture results of national programmes and lessons learned The new and\\ninnovative methodologies used by UNDP such as sense-making, rapid integrated\\nassessment and development finance assessment, as well as big data collection\\nand visualization, will provide instruments and comparative advantage for UNDP\\nto be  partner of choice for the national monitoring
