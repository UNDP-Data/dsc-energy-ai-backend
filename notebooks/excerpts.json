The renewable energy share in Albania is predominantly hydropower of which accounts for 95% of all generating capacity, with the remaining divided between solar (1%) and crude oil (4%). The remaining share of supply comes from imports making Albania a net energy importer and thus heavily reliant on imports. Being also heavily reliant on hydropower also means that renewable generation is sensitive to rainfall, of which has seen considerable annual variations and a steady decline in recent years. This is likely to further decline with the effects of climate change. In addition to hydropower resources, Albania also has abundant solar and wind resources, which are currently almost entirely untapped.

Algeria aims to add 13.5 GW of solar energy capacity by 2030. AREP supports Algeria, to deploy this huge utility-scale solar energy generation capacity through a transparent, well-structured and competitive selection of Independent Power Producers (IPPs). AREP’s specific objective is to provide technical and financial assistance to complete and roll-out the technical, legal and institutional framework that will allow private IPPs to come and invest in feasible and financially profitable solar energy projects. AREP components are: (i) solar sites identification, prioritization and preparation- solar potential determination, technical, financial and legal, environmental and social studies/agreements for each selected site; (ii) Capacity building on “Preparation of",

The Government’s commitment and principles to promotion of energy efficiency are given in the Law on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (2005) and the National Program on Energy Saving and Renewable Energy (2007). Armenia has significant potential for energy efficiency and can recoup sizable economic benefits through utilization of this potential. Although its economic activity is less energy intensive than compared to other economies in the region, large potential remains for further efficiency improvements (up to 5% of the country’s GDP, as was estimated in a World Bank study in 2008). The highest economic effectiveness is envisaged through energy efficiency investments in the public sector. Other dominant sectors to be",

Because of Armenia’s dependence on energy imports, energy prices are largely beyond our control. Over the past decade as we emerged from an energy crisis, we learned the importance of developing our domestic energy resources, and transformed our government institutions to support private sector involvement in the energy industry. In just a few years, a robust and thriving small hydropower industry has emerged from these efforts. Despite this success, our energy sector remains vulnerable to price shocks and reliability problems, and climate change continues to threaten our natural resources and well-being. Yet in the face of these risks, we have a great opportunity: much of Armenia’s conventional energy generation infrastructure will need to be replaced in the coming years. If",

The Barbados National Energy Policy (BNEP) 2019-2030 document is designed to achieve the 100% renewable energy and carbon neutral transformational goals by 2030, becoming the first island-state in the world to do so. Our goal is to be 100% renewable by 2030! BNEP is an energy revolution that will enrich the lives of all Barbadians and inspire others around the world. Over the years, Barbados has sought to maintain an energy sector where energy resources are universally available at reasonable prices. The island can be proud of the fact that there is virtually 100% access to electricity.Specific goals include: Provision of reliable, safe, affordable, sustainable, modern and climate friendly energy services to all residents and visitors.

RATIONALE Sector context Belarus enjoys a strategic location between Russia and the European Union, and therefore plays a key role as a transit route for energy exports from Russia to European markets (outright transit of oil and gas and export of oil products refined in the country). The country's economic growth has been strong in recent years, despite the roadblocks in a centrally directed economy with, still, a high rate of inflation. Until recently, it received heavily discounted oil and natural gas from Russia and much of its GDP growth can be attributed to the re-export of Russian crude oil and export of refined oil products",

The NEP is expected to create a conducive environment that will not only facilitate investment in the energy sector but also add value to export revenues, facilitate production in other sectors of the economy and create employment within the energy sector. It also sets a foundation that will steer the utilization of locally available energy resources optimally and efficiently to ensure that Botswana attains a sustainable and low carbon economic development.

The 2005 elections enabled Burundi to re-establish a democratic system and enhance the business environment for private sector development, which led to an average economic growth rate of 4 per cent1 between 2005 and 2014. However, the 2015 political crisis slowed the country’s economic development trajectory, and peacebuilding and social cohesion have remained challenging since then. 2. The country has continued to implement its national development agenda with",

        "extract": "Background Only two percent of Burundi’s population have access to electricity. Of these, most live in Bujumbura, the capital city. Since 1993, the country’s energy infrastructure has been largely destroyed as a result of inter-ethnic conflict. Additionally, an embargo in 1996 and the scarcity of for\u0002eign currency have contributed to energy projects receiving little investment. Burundi’s electrical grid supplies 30.6 MW, most of which comes from the Rwegura and Mugere hydropower plants (generating 18 and 8 MW respectively). The extreme demand on these two plants makes the power supply highly unreliable. During the dry season the power supply deficit can increase from 13 to 23.5 MW, meaning that people increasingly turn to expensive, diesel\u0002powered generators as an alternative source of energy. Technical and commercial losses of 24.4% have further reduced the availability of electricity. Burundi’s energy envi\u0002ronment also harms its natural resources: high population growth and reliance on traditional biomass for cooking have contributed to severe deforestation, exacerbating the damage",

This is the objective that this Government has set itself and represents the serious aspiration of our country to bring greater and better opportunities to our fellow Chileans. Transforming Chile into a developed country not only implies achieving certain macroeconomic goals, but also making a significant step forward, both quantitatively and qualitatively in education, strengthening healthcare guarantees; making decisive progress in the access to and quality of housing; and putting an end, once and for all, to extreme poverty so as to improve the circumstances of thousands of Chileans who currently live in poverty.

The Policy which was approved by Cabinet on 16th March 2010 is intended to guide the development and management of Ghana’s energy sector, especially the emerging oil and gas sector, following the discovery in commercial quantities of petroleum resources in 2007. Apart from creating a conducive environment for increased investment in the energy sector in Ghana to create jobs, national value added or export revenues, the policy also seeks to put in place a framework for the efficient management of the energy resources as well as revenues accruing therefrom. The formulation of the policy has been done through an extensive consultative process which has involved the review of policies of several countries, discussions with institutions of Government, local authorities, civil society organizations and academia, among others.

The formulation of this National Energy Policy (NEP), Liberia’s first, started in early 2006 with provisions in the 150-Day Plan deliverables and followed with a National Energy Stakeholders Forum in October 2006, the publication of the National Energy Sector White Paper, the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Process, and the full Poverty Reduction Strategy.

As such, it has put the energy sector as a priority in its National Development Agenda. The Government further realises that sustainable development and management of energy sector through well-defined policies including legal and institutional frameworks, international assistance from development partners, and partnerships with the private sector positively impact on other sectors. In view of this, the National Energy Policy of 2003 has been revised to provide a new policy direction and guidance to all stakeholders in the implementation of energy interventions. This is necessary in order to spur development as aspired for in the Malawi Vision 2020, and Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) III in the national agenda, and Sustainable Energy for All Initiative and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the international agenda.

This is why more than 20 years ago the Maldives raised its voice on this impending threat to the survival of our nation. Since then, we are striving to improve the quality of life of the people of the Maldives and to provide environmental quality for those who visit our country for holidays and business. Climate change associated with greenhouse gas emissions coupled with the realization that the world oil reserves will run out, has given strong impetus for the Government to explore alternative energy sources not only for energy security but also for meeting the sustainable development aspirations of the people of our nation.",

Despite continuous endeavors together with support from Development Partners, Nepal’s energy supply and demand balance, particularly electricity remains in deficit. A comparison to international and regional data demonstrates not only the inadequacies in terms of access to energy and modern energy services in Nepal, but also very high energy intensity resulting from inefficiency in energy consumption patterns. Although there is a tremendous potential for hydropower generation, huge gap exists between demand and supply of electricity in the country. The gap becomes more critical during the dry season with long hours of load shedding affecting households, commerce, industries and the economy as a whole. The sluggish growth of the supply side together with inefficient energy consumption patterns has proven to be one of",

The Plan seeks to uplift the well-being of all Filipinos by securing access to reliable and affordable energy services and technologies. It also looks at enforceable policies and feasible programs to support the government’s goal of achieving inclusive growth for all. Energy and power have become an indispensable need in our modern world. Advances in technological innovations have made demand for energy more compelling. And to meet that basic need, the DOE is tasked to deliver its mandate of ensuring that energy is readily available to make lives comfortable and our businesses competitive. However, the complex energy challenges facing us today require long-term strategies, strong collaboration, and firm decision-making to achieve realistic and long-term solutions to the increasing energy demands of the country. Thus, this PEP outlines the energy priorities that are innovative, sustainable, and clean.",

It is in this light that the Department of Energy remains firm and resolute to aggressively pursue the energy agenda focused on enhancing the country’s access to energy. This is instrumental in reducing poverty as well as promoting social equity. The development of indigenous energy resources is critical in achieving greater energy supply security for the country. Likewise, the implementation of relevant energy reforms will encourage more investors to engage in energy projects in a business-friendly environment. The trickle-down effect is a wider range of economic opportunities in the countryside.

Every productive sector in the economy relies on the provision of energy. It is therefore essential that the policy framework in this sector be sensitive to the ever-rising challenges not only in this sector but in the economy as a whole. The National Energy Policy (NEP) seeks to promote the optimal supply and utilisation of energy, for socio-economic development in a safe, sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. It is clear that the essence of the NEP’s objectives will remain valid even though the social, political, environmental and economic situation changes continually. Such changes will",

Foreword In 2008, the Republic of the Marshall Islands experienced unprecedented increases in the costs of imported petroleum fuel and staple food items. This high level of inflation had serious impacts on the economy and people of the RMI and prompted President Litokwa Tomeing and his Cabinet to declare a State of Economic Emergency on July 3, 2008. This led to an ADB-funded analysis of key energy issues in September 2008 and the Government’s decision to develop a national energy policy and an action plan for its implementation. Although fuel prices fell dramatically in late 2008, they are again increasing substantially and imported petroleum still accounts for a high percentage",

The first is to deliver clean, secure, affordable energy for all citizens of Palau while treating the environment responsibly. The second is to respond to the risks of climate change by adaptation to changes and by mitigation through reducing the greenhouse gases caused by the production and use of energy. In addition Palau faces a challenge that it shares with other small island countries, namely it’s extremely high dependence from imported fuels. This National Energy Policy which has been developed in an inclusive and participatory process clearly sets out the government’s policy vision. It forms the basis for a strategic action plan which ensures that the policy vision becomes a reality. This policy",

The rapid shift from subsistence to cash or monetary economy in contemporary Tuvalu as posed by the effects of globalization paved the way for such immediate and fitting policies and responses to be devised to address such swift changes. TNEP is no doubt a product of these much needed responses, and its sole objective is to improve the well-being of the Tuvalu people by promoting the use of its renewable energy resources, which are cost-effective, reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable. TNEP was developed by the Energy Department and SOPAC following successive consultation workshops that were conducted by a Technical Assistant from SOPAC and energy stakeholders on Funafuti in 2005.

Tillman Thomas Prime Minister of Grenada MINISTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, INFORMATION, INFORMATION COMMUNI\u0002CATION TECHNOLOGY & NATIONAL MOBILIZATION formulated an ambitious National Energy Policy (NEP). This Policy is very urgent and timely now that the global energy market is again vulnerable to the high volatility of oil prices. Soaring prices for petroleum and petroleum-related products as a result of the variable weather patterns in Europe and North America, the forecasted rising demand for these commodities in the manufacturing sectors in the USA, Europe and the BRIC nations, renewed concerns over nuclear safety after the Fukushima incident, as well as the political instability of oil producing and oil exporting countries in North Africa and the Middle East warrant that Grenada needs to provide suitable options in transitioning to a low carbon economy based on the utilization of its indigenous alternative sources",
